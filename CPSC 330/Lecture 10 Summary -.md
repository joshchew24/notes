- **Carry out feature transformations on somewhat complicated dataset**
	- converting or scaling features make them more suitable for a model
		- normalize or standardize numerical data
		- encode categorical variables
		- create polynomial features
- **Visualize transformed features as a dataframe**
- **Use `Ridge` and `RidgeCV`**
- **Explain how `alpha` hyperparameter of `Ridge` relates to the fundamental tradeoff**
- **Explain the effect of `alpha` on the magnitude of the learned coefficients**
- **Examine coefficients of transformed features**
- **Appropriately select a scoring metric given a regression problem**
- **Interpret and communicate the meanings of different scoring metrics on regression problems**
    - **MSE, RMSE, $R^2$, MAPE**
- **Apply log-transform on the target values in a regression problem with `TransformedTargetRegressor`**
