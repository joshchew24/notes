- **Broadly explain the idea of [[Ensembles]]** 
	- combine multiple ML models to improve performance compared to individual models
- **Explain how does predict work in the context of random forest models**
- **Explain the sources of randomness in random forest algorithm**
- **Explain the relation between number of estimators and the fundamental tradeoff in the context of random forests**
- **Use `scikit-learn`'s random forest classification and regression models and explain their main hyperparameters** 
- **Use other tree-based models such as as `XGBoost`, `LGBM` and `CatBoost`** 
- **Broadly explain ensemble approaches, in particular model averaging and stacking**
- **Use `scikit-learn` implementations of these ensemble methods**
