# Feature Selection
- Find the features	(columns) $X$ that are important for predicting	$y$, and remove the features that aren't. 

- Given $X = \begin{bmatrix}x_1 & x_2 & \dots & x_n\\  \\  \\  \end{bmatrix}$ and $y = \begin{bmatrix}\\  \\  \\  \end{bmatrix}$, find the columns $1 \leq j \leq n$ in $X$ that are important for predicting $y$.
