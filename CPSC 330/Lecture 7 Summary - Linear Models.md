# Lecture 7 Summary - Linear Models
- **Explain the general intuition behind [[Linear Models]]**
	- learn a linear relationship between the inputs and output
- **Explain how `predict` works for linear regression**
- **Use `scikit-learn`'s `Ridge` model**
- **Demonstrate how the `alpha` hyperparameter of `Ridge` is related to the fundamental tradeoff**
- **Explain the difference between linear regression and logistic regression;**
- **Use `scikit-learn`'s `LogisticRegression` model and `predict_proba` to get probability scores**
- **Explain the advantages of getting probability scores instead of hard predictions during classification**
- **Broadly describe linear SVMs** 
- **Explain how can you interpret model predictions using coefficients learned by a linear model**
- **Explain the advantages and limitations of linear classifiers**
