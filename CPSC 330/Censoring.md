## Types of censoring
There are also various types and sub-types of censoring we didn't cover:

- What we did **today** is called "**right censoring**"
- **Sub-types** within right censoring
  - Did **everyone join** at the **same time**?
  - Are there **other reasons** the data might be censored at random times, e.g. the **person died**?
- **Left** censoring
- **Interval** censoring

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censoring_(statistics)):
> - Left censoring – a data point is below a certain value but it is unknown by how much.
> - Interval censoring – a data point is somewhere on an interval between two values.
> - Right censoring – a data point is above a certain value but it is unknown by how much.
