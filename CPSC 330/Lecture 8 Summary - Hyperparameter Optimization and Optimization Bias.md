- **explain the need for [[Hyperparameters]] optimization**
	- helps enhance performance of the model
		- efficiency in training
		- prediction quality
		- model complexity
	- find the most effective and efficient model for a givein dataset
- **carry out hyperparameter optimization using `sklearn`'s `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`**
	- [[Hyperparameters#Exhaustive Grid Search|Grid Search]]
		- systematically tests all possible combinations of hyperparameters (from given set)
		- determines which combination gave best performance based on specified scoring method
	- [[Hyperparameters#Randomized Hyperparameter Search|Randomized Search]]
		- randomly samples hyperparameter values to test from given distributions
		- tests a specified number of combinations
			- or until a time limit is reached
		- faster than GridSearch
			- not exhaustive
			- more efficient because we test a new value for every feature on every run
- **explain different hyperparameters of `GridSearchCV`**
- **explain the importance of selecting a good range for the values.** 
- **explain optimization bias**
- **identify and reason when to trust and not trust reported accuracies**
