# Word Embeddings
- create representations of words so that distances between words in the feature space indicate relationships between them
- useful to capture word meaning 
	- in terms of relationships between words
	- draw useful inferences to solve meaning-related problems
	- find relationships between words
		- which are similar
		- which have positive/negative connotations
- word similarty
	- numeric features use [[Euclidean Distance]] 
	- sparse features use [[Dot Product]] or [[Cosine Distance]]
