# Linear Models
- fundamental and widely used class of models
- predict using **linear function** of the input features
## Types
### [[Linear Regression]]
### [[Logistic Regression]]
### [[Linear SVM]]
## Confidence
- Least confident cases occur with points close to the decision boundary
- Most confident cases occur with points far away from the decision boundary
- Over confident cases are when the model is confident about the prediction but the prediction is wrong
	- e.g. cities in Alaska are likely to be predicted as being in Canada, this data is not captured by the linear model
