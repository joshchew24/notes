# Transfer Learning
- fine-tuning a pre-trained [[Neural Networks]] for your specific need
- common in [[Computer VIsion]] and [[Natural Language Processing]]
- three common approaches
	1. Using pre-trained models **out-of-the-box**
    2. Using pre-trained models as **feature extractor** and training your own model with these features
    3. Starting with weights of pre-trained models and **fine-tuning the weights** for your task.
