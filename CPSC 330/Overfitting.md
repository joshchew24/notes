# Overfitting
- low training error
	- large gap between this and validation error
	- **validation error does not necessarily decrease with training error**
- very complex model
	- learn unreliable patterns to get every single training example correct
	- i.e. model is fitted to closely to the training data and does not generalize well to new examples
