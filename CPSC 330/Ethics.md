# Ethics
- **statistical parity**:
	- the proportion of each segment of a protected class (e.g. sex) should receive the positive outcome at equal rates
	- e.g. proportion of loans approved for female should be equal to male
- **equal opportunity**
	- each group should get the positive outcome at equal rates
