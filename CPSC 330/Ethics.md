- **statistical parity**:
	- each group of a protected class (e.g. sex) should receive the positive outcome at equal proportions
	- e.g. proportion of loans approved for female should be equal to male
- **equal opportunity**

- take **autonomous actions** in a way that obscures responsibility
	- autonomous weapons; self-driving cars; loan approval systems
- disproportionately affect **vulnerable/marginalized groups**
	- automated decision making tools trained in ways that may encode existing biases
