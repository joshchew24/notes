# Learning Objectives
## Lecture 1: Introduction
## Lecture 2: Baselines, Decision Trees
- identify whether a given problem could be solved using [[Supervised Learning|Supervised Machine Learning]] or not; 
- differentiate between supervised and [[Unsupervised Learning]];
- explain machine learning terminology such as features, targets, predictions, training, and error;
- differentiate between [[Classification]] and [[Regression]] problems;
- use `DummyClassifier` and `DummyRegressor` as baselines for machine learning problems;
- explain the `fit` and `predict` paradigm and use `score` method of ML models; 
- broadly describe how decision tree prediction works;
- use `DecisionTreeClassifier` and `DecisionTreeRegressor` to build decision trees using `scikit-learn`; 
- visualize decision trees; 
- explain the difference between parameters and hyperparameters; 
- explain the concept of decision boundaries;
- explain the relation between model complexity and decision boundaries.
