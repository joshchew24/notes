## [[Supervised Learning]]
Training a model from **input data and its corresponding targets** to predict targets for **new examples**.
## [[Unsupervised Learning]]
Training a model to find patterns in a dataset, typically an **unlabelled dataset**.
## [[Reinforcement Learning]]
A family of algorithms for finding suitable **actions** to take in a given situation in order to **maximize a reward**.
