# Supervised Learning
- training data comprises a set of observations ($X$) and their corresponding targets ($y$)
- we wish to find a model function $f$ that relates $X$ to $y$
- use the model function to predict targets of new examples
- set of predicted labels of $y$ are denoted as $\hat{y}$

> [!NOTE] Summary
> Train a function from labelled data to predict the labels of unlabelled data
