# Lecture 5 Summary - Preprocessing and sklearn Pipelines
- **explain motivation for [[Pre-processing]] in supervised machine learning**
	- raw data often contains inconsistencies, missing values, and is not often in a format conducive to optimal machine learning model performance
	- proper preprocessing improves the quality of the data, ensures it is clean, normalized, and suitable for the model
	- this can significantly enhance model accuracy and efficiency
- **identify when to implement feature transformations such as imputation, scaling, and one-hot encoding in a machine learning model development pipeline**
	- [[Pre-processing#Imputation|Imputation]]
		- apply when there are missing values in a dataset
		- value to impute can be mean, median, default, or sometimes obtained via more complex methods 
	- [[Pre-processing#Scaling|Scaling]]
		- apply when dataset has multiple numeric features with different scales
			- scale can affect the influence of certain features on a model's outcome
		- most ML algorithms assume data will be on the same scale
		- **standardization**: subtract the mean and divide by standard deviation
		- **normalization**: scale data to fixed range, like 0 to 1
	- [[One-hot encoding]]
		- apply to categorical feature to convert to numeric
		- new columns are binary presence indicators for each category from the original feature
- **use `sklearn` transformers for applying feature transformations on your dataset**
	- `SimpleImputer`, `StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`, `OneHotEncoder`
- **discuss golden rule in the context of feature transformations**
	- make sure to fit the transformers on **ONLY** the training data 
	- apply the transformations to the whole dataset after
- **use `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` and `sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline` to build a preliminary machine learning pipeline**
	- [[Pipelines]] chain multiple preprocessing steps and model training into a single coherent workflow
		- ensures all steps applied consistently and repeatably
	- `make_pipeline` is shorthand for creating a pipeline
		- automatically names each step in pipeline based on function
