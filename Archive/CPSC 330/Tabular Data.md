# Tabular Data
- in [[Supervised Learning|supervised machine learning]], input data is typically organized in **tabular** format
	- rows are **examples** ($n$)
		- samples, records, instances
	- columns ($d$) are **features** ($X$)
		- inputs, predictors, explanatory variables, regressors, independent variables, covariates
	- one column is typically the **target** ($y$)
		- outputs, outcomes, response variable, dependent variable, labels (if categorical)
- first need to separate $X$ from $y$
