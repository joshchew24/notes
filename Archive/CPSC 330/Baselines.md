# Baselines
- simple machine learning algorithm based on simple rules of thumb
	- e.g. always predict the most frequently label in the training set
- used to sanity check our ML model
- serves as a reference point for more complex models

## [[sklearn]]
- `DummyClassifier`
- `DummyRegressor`
	- predicts mean, median, or constant value of the training set for all examples
