# 2.1
- the amount of light that reaches the surface is a function of the angle between the light beam and the surface normal
- at surface, light power/length
- = p/1/cos(theta) = pcos(theta)
- intensity at surface
- $I_{d} = k_{d}i_{d}cos(\theta)$ where $k$ is diffuse reflection coefficient
- $\theta$ is angle between normal and light direction

## 2.2
- $\phi$ is the angle between reflection and viewer
- $I_s = k_s i_s cos^{\alpha}(\phi)$ 
	- specular reflection coefficient $k$
	- specular light power $i$
	- "shininess" $\alpha$
- falloff of light around the reflection direction
