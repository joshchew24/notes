# Protein
- involed in almost every biological process
1. structural material in muscles, connective tissue, organs, hemoglobin
2. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">basic component of enzymes, hormones, transporters, immune system </mark>
3. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">maintains and repairs protein-containing tissues</mark>
4. energy source
- composed of a chain of amino acids
	- 20 different types
	- only 9 are essential
		- dietary essential because cannot produce ourselves
- half of our protein in muscle
	- remainder in skin, collagen, blood, enzymes, immunoproteins, organs, etc
## Quantity
- how much protein do people need?
- [[Macronutrients#AMDR Table|AMDR table]]
- Alternatively, body weight dependent
- daily protein intake by g per kg of body weight
	- protein requirements are increased in some circumstances
		- clinical conditions, second half of pregnancy, breastfeeding, infants and young children

| Group | g/kg/d |
| ---- | ---- |
| 7-12 months | 1.2 g |
| 1 -3 years | 1.05 g |
| 14-18 | 0.85 g |
| 19+ | 0.80 g |
| pregnant | 1.1 g |
| breastfeeding | 1.3 g |
### Excess Consumption
- up to 35% of kcal without ill effects
- >45%: nausea, weakness, diarrhea, eventually death
- high intake linked to osteoporosis, kidney stones, cancer, heart disease, obesity
## Quality
### Complete proteins
- contain all of the essential amino acids in amounts needed to support body's protein requirements
- typically derived from animals
	- e.g. meat, dairy, eggs
### Incomplete proteins
- deficient in one or more essential amino acids
- typically derived from plants
	- e.g. grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, vegetables
	- exception is **soy**
#### Limiting Amino Acid
- the amino acid in an incomplete protein that is present in least amount relative to the requirements for that amino acid
#### Complimentary Proteins
- protein that is incomplete on its own, but complete when combined with another protein source with a complimentary amino acid content
- e.g. legumes + cereals
	- falafel and pita
	- beans and rice
	- chana masala and naan
	- bean burrito
	- peanut butter on bread
