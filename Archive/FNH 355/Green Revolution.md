# Green Revolution
- increase in agricultural production due to:
	- high yield varities of cereal grains
	- irrigation
	- fertilizers (synthetic nitrogen source)
	- pesticides, herbicides (increase yield)
- 1950: producing 700 million tons of grain from 600 million hectares
- 1990: 1.9 billion tons from same amount of land
	- increase of 170%
## Benefits
- dramatic increases in yields of staple cereal grains
- reduced/eliminated need for food imports in some countries
- reduction in poverty/hunger in countries most affected
	- effects are unevenly distributed among population
## Disadvantages
- dependent on fertilizers, irrigation, chemical pesticides, mechanical plowing
- environmental effects
- expensive
	- poor farmers cannot afford equipment
	- e.g. Bangladesh, "modern" farming costs 60% more startup cost
- loss of crop diversity; depletion of soil fertility
- increasing disparity between rich landowners and tenant farmers
- increased yields were not experienced everywhere
## Sustainable Intensification
- more output from same land area while reducing environmental impacts
	- and considering social, political, economic factors
- i.e. produce more in an environmentally sustainable way
- use resources at a rate that doesn't exceed Earth's capacity to replace them
> [!Definition] Sustainable Production is Characterized By:
> 1. Using crop or livestock breeds that produce a lot relative to inputs
> 2. Avoiding unnecessary external inputs
> 	- anything that is needed is external to the production
> 	- Labor, machinery, diesel, gasoline, seeds, irrigation
> 3. Acroecology: nutrient cycling, nitrogen fixation, predation and parasitism
> 4. Minimizing strategies with negative effects on the environment and/or human health
> 5. Using human and social capital
> 6. Minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, negative impacts on biodiversity, etc.
