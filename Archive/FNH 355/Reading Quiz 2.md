# Reading Quiz 2
7. 
	1. A) The most critical phase of life to have good nutritional health is the first 1000 days, which covers pregnancy to a person's second birthday. This period of time is when the child undergoes the most rapid growth and development, and therefore has increased nutritional needs. 
	2. B) One consequence of undernutrition during this period is that the child will likely experience stunted growth and will never reach their full potential both physically and cognitively. This can also have impactful consequences on this person's family and community, as stunted people are likely to earn lower wages due to their reduced cognitive ability. 
	3. C) The first consequence is problematic as children are deprived of their dreams, often due to circumstances out of their control. The second consequence is problematic because as generations of stunted people enter society, it is difficult for them to contribute at the same capacity as someone who was adequately nutritioned and therefore cognitively average.
8. 
	1. A
		1. Large scale factors influence many other factors that can cause undernutrition. For example, political instability can interrupt government support for struggling communities, which would lead to inadequate dietary intake. 
		
		2. Causes and consequences can be cyclical. Adults affected by chronic malnutrition can have difficulties raising their own children with adequate nutrition, propagating the problem intergenerationally. 
		
		3. Adults with long-term consequences from malnutrition struggle to contribute as meaningfully to society and to their communities. which is a factor of the second basic cause of child nutrition on the chart. 
		
		4. Good care and feeding practices are crucial to good health, as inadequate practice is directly linked to inadequate dietary intake, maternal and child undernutrition, and disease. 
		
		5. The underlying cause of child undernutrition is ultimately societal and heavily influenced by the government. Factors like corruption, incompetency, warfare, etc. will trickle down to affect the most vulnerable people.
	2. B
		1. The updated framework shifts the narrative into a positive perspective, instead focusing on the beneficial outcomes of good nutrition, rather than the consequences of poor nutrition. This framing may be more motivating to people, offering them rewards rather than pushing them with fear. 
		
		2. The updated framework is clearer and easier to understand, while also providing more specific details in each element. This will convey the information more clearly to its readers and help communities use this knowledge to improve their nutritional state. 
	3. These frameworks provide a concise way to break down a malnutrition situation into different factors, enabling further detailed analysis on each part. For example, if we were to examine Hagirso's case, we can identify one of the basic causes or enabling determinants of his malnutrition as the 2003 famine in Ethiopia. One underlying cause/determinant of his condition is that his mother was malnourished when she was pregnant and gave birth to him, resulting in a low birthweight. An immediate cause/determinant was that Hagirso was unable to receive adequate dietary intake. One of the outcomes of his malnourishment is that he is stunted, both physically and cognitively, and his education is severely inhibited.
