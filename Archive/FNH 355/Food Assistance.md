# Food Assistance
- in recent years, a shift from [[Food Aid]] (in-kind donations) to "food assistance" (funding local/regional procurement)
## Local/Regional Procurement (LRP) vs. transoceanic delivery of food aid

|                                | LRP                                                         | Transoceanic Delivery                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Timeliness                     | Quicker Delivery                                            | Longer Delivery                                                         |
| Cost                           | Often cheaper (especially grains and pulses)                | Particular items may be cheaper (e.g., fortified oil, corn soil blend)  |
| Receipient Satisfaction        | Generally preferred overall (quality, storability, texture) | Preferred on some criteria (cleanliness, perceived nutritional quality) |
| Price impacts on Local Markets | Does not appear to have significant impact                  | May have negative impacts on local markets                              |
