# Fat
- lipids = fats, oils, cholestrol, triglcerides
- not water soluble 
## Functions
1. concentrated energy source
2. carrier for essential fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins (D, E, A, K)
3. adds flavour and palatability to food
4. contributes feeling of satiety (fullness)
5. component of cell membranes, vitamin D, sex hormones
## Types
1. triglycerides
	- ![[Pasted image 20240121221825.png]]
	- 98% of our dietary fat intake and vast majority of body's fat stores
	- used by cells for energy and tissue maintenence
	- fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated
		- hydrocarbons
2. saturated fat (contains saturated fatty acids)
	- carbon atoms are attached to as many hydrogen atoms as possible
		- i.e. saturated with carbons
		- i.e. all carbons are single bonded together
	- solid at room temperature
		- mostly found in animal products
			- exceptions: palm oil, coconut oil
3. unsaturated fat (contains unsaturated fatty acids)
	- contain fewer than the maximum hydrogens
	- there is at least one double bond between carbons
	1. monounsaturated
		- one double bond between carbons
	2. polyunsaturated
		- more than one double bond between carbons
		2. EPA
		3. DHA
		4. Trans
		5. Linoleic acid: Omega-3 (ESSENTIAL)
		6. Alpha-linolenic acid: Omega-6 (ESSENTIAL)
	- liquid at room temperature
		- best sources are plant foods
4. Cholesterol
## Excess Consumption
- higher fat intakes (higher % kcal from fat) associated with lower risk of overall mortality
- higher carbohydrate intakes associated with higher risk of overall mortality
