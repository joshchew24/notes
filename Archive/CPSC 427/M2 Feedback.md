- improved gameplay
	- player can draw while dying
	- ~~acceleration does not scale with time~~ DONE

	- sprite sheet animation is not abstract enough. Currently hacked in directly to the key controls and ability to modify/add animations is not there including setting animation speed.
- tutorial
	- ~~movement controls somehow got reset, this is fixed~~
- stability
	- game crashes if drawing during certain events (death, new level, restart, load checkpoint)
- bug list
	- report all known bugs
- creative
	- A* pathfinding does not have platforms as collisions (apparently it does?)
