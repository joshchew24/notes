# Isolatability
- able to isolate a fault within CUT
	- quickly determine what causes failure
- can be challenging in modern systems with many (often third party) dependencies
	- sometimes requires isolation through simulation
		- i.e. mocking or stubbing dependencies
			- take known inputs and return known values instead of executing complex code
