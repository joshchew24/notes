# Black Box Testing
validate program without any knowledge of how the system is implemented

- test against specification 
	- testing based on contracts
- can be written prior to implementation
- hard to reason about test strength with respect to implementation

### [[Equivalence Class Partitioning]]
#### [[Input Partitioning]]
#### [[Output Partitioning]]
### [[State Transition Testing]]
