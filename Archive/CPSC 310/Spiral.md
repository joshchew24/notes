- tries to increase responsiveness of [[Waterfall]]
- revisits each phase on each iteration
## Phases
- Planning
	- gather and analyze requirements
- Risk Analysis
	- identify sources of risk and mitigation strategies
- Engineering
	- system is built and validated
- Evaluation
	- system is validated externally with customers to inform future iterations

## Advantages
- greater sensitivity to changes in requirements (compared to Waterfall)
- keeps customers involved
	- avoid building the wrong piece of software

## Disadvantages
- costly to perform effective risk analysis and review
