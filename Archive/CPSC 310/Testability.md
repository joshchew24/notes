# Testability
a successful test
- is able to execute the CUT 
- can trigger a defect
- propagates incorrect result to a certain program point
- incorrect result can be checked against the expected behaviour

## Four Properties of Testability
- not commonly considered on their own
	- e.g. if you have an isolatable unit but you cannot control it to trigger the fault
	- e.g. if you have a controllable unit but you cannot isolate specific failures
