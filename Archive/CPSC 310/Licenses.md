# Licenses
- used in conjunction with other mechanisms to enable IP monetization without release of ownership

## Software
- all source code is protected by copyright
- licenses clarify 
	- how the code can be used
	- can it be modified
	- can it be distributed by others

## Open Source licenses
### General Public License (GPLv3)
- enables software to be used, shared, and modified
- *copyleft* license
	- license must be retained with code when it is modified or distributed
- projects using GPLv3 code cannot use a less-restrictive license on their own product

### Lesser General Public License (LGPLv3)
- *copyleft*
- more flexible than GPLv3
- requires that changes to code licensed under LGPLv2 be shared
- when used as a library by a product, the proprietary code need not be freely available
- software using LGPL libraries can be shared under a more restrictive license 

### Mozilla Public License (MPLv2)
- *copyleft*
- increased flexibility over LGPLv3
- mandates changes to MPL licensed *files* be released
### CC-by (Creative Commons)
- set of standardized licenses that can apply in a variety of situations
- succinct
- aim to make it easier to license work
	- enabling others to use, extend, and share the licensed work
