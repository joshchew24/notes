# Milestone 6 Peer Review

1. For Milestone 1, I collaborated with the team to create the submission document and ER Diagram
   
   For Milestone 2, I collaborated with the team and attended office hours to find out how we can improve the problems with our ER diagram. 
   
   I helped derive the schema from the ER diagram, and wrote the SQL DDL statements to create the tables.
   
   I collaborated with the team to make decisions regarding semantics, schema, and functional dependencies. Brandon and Celine were mainly responsible for the normalization process. 
   
   For Milestone 3, the team collectively worked on establishing a project timeline for milestone 4. I also added our tasks as Github issues to increase visibility across the project.
   
   For Milestone 4, I worked on the Update, Join, Aggregation with Group By, and Nested Aggregation with Group By queries. Each person was assigned a few queries to implement, front to back. 
   
   As a team, we reviewed each other's code through pull requests, and helped each other whenever someone ran into technical problems. 
   
   We collaborated on putting together the submission document, and checking over our work with the rubric.
2. Brandon Yuen 33.33, Celine Chen 33.33, Joshua Chew 33.33
3. Celine designed a frontend in Figma, although we did not end up having enough time to implement it.
   Josh implemented a GUI button to reset the database, so that the team would not have to run the SQL script manually.
