# Extreme Programming (XP)
- one of the first widely influential agile methods
- systems should always be buildable
- developers should be willing to start small and adapt and refactor their systems as the need arose
	- instead of investing huge up-front engineering efforts
## Key Principles
### Communication
- open and continual communication between all stakeholders
- keeps projects on track
- all stakeholders are aware of the schedule
	- aware of the impact of their decision making
### Simplicity
- simplest possible solution
- engineers can validate work with customers before tackling more expensive or challenging solutions
### Feedback
- combine feedback from tests, customers and team
- enables more knowledge to be applied
- ensures most locally 'correct' decisions are made
### Courage
- be wiling to discard failed experiments
- experiments are not sunk-cost
	- rather, opportunity to learn and improve the overall system
### Respect
- breaking the build is unacceptable
	- slows down team
	- hurts velocity
- focus on long-term understandability of your code
	- respecting the time a future developer needs to understand your code
