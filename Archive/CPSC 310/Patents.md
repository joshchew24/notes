## Software
- challenging: software is considered an *abstract idea* that cannot usually be patented
- inventor needs to demonstrate that the software represents a specific novel implementation of the invention
	- not a straightforward application of the abstract idea
- difficult to demonstrate a software invention to be novel and non-obvious
