# Solid State Disks (SSDs)
- flash memory based on EEPROMs
- storage technology based on flash memory
- advantages
	- no spinning disks or moving parts
	- less likely to be damaged
	- low power requirements (1/3 to 1/2)
	- less heat, therefore less cooling
	- quieter
	- faster reads (0.1ms vs 5-10 ms)
- disadvantages
	- cost (much more expensive per byte)
		- $2/GB vs $0.05-0.10/GB
	- smaller capacity
	- Random writes are slower than reads because you canâ€™t just write a single, changed page p to disk; you have to write a whole bank (chunk) X of data.
		- e.g., block X is 0.5 MB; you have to copy X and identify changes, then erase the whole original block (e.g., 1 ms) before re-writing
	- limited number of write cycles (1-5 million?), and then the block of memory can no longer be used
	- SSD is only 1 order of magnitude closer to RAM speed
		- RAM and HDD is 5 orders apart
