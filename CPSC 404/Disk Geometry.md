- platter
	- spin to let disk head read (e.g. 15000 rpm)
	- not many platters per disk (8-10)
- surface
	- two surfaces per platter
	- 
- whole arm assembly sweeps together
	- positions head on desired track $k$
- all tracks with same track # (e.g. $k$) compose cylinder $k$
- only one track head operates at a time
- one head per surface
- two surfaces per platters
- block/page size is a multiple of sector size (which is fixed)
