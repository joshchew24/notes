# Micronutrient Malnutrition
- also known as "hidden hunger"
	- not as obvious as other forms of undernutrition such as stunting and wasting
- approximately 1 in 3 people in the world are affected
## [[Iron]]
- [[Anemia]]
## [[Zinc]]
## [[Iodine]]
## [[Vitamin A]]
## Global Hidden Hunger Index (GHHI)
- metric to indicate severity of micro-malnutrition
- comonly used to assess nutritional status of preschool children (< age 5)
- calculated as average of three nutritional indicators
	- prevalence of stunting, anemia, and vitamin A deficiency
## Prevention and Treatment
### Supplementation
- concentrated micronutrients in pill, powder, or liquid form
### Fortification
- small amounts of micronutrients added to common food products
### Biofortification
- agronomic and plant-breeding practices increase concentration of particular micronutrients in staple crops
- e.g. golden rice
	- high vitamin A concentration
