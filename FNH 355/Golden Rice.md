# Golden Rice
- genetically modified crop
	- i.e. produced in lab
	- using genetics to improve the micronutrient content of food
		- through conventional breeding or genetic engineering
- added pathway to produce beta-carotene ([[Vitamin A]])
	- transfer corn genes to rice
	- human body convers beta-carotene to vitamin A
- not currently available due to "extreme interpretation of precautionary principle"
	- i.e. will GMO cause harm?
- factors for farmers
	- crop yield and profit
	- will people accept the rice if it is a GMO
- politics of regulating GMO has resulted in delay of 20 years of making golden rice available
	- co-inventor called this a crime against humanity
## Benefits
- reduces vitamin A deficiency
- one cup of golden rice per day would reduce risk
- humanitarian intention
	- it is currently being researched and advocated for by a non-profit group in the Phillipines
- distributed for free
	- does not create more debt for poor farmers
- easy subsitution for regular rice
- increases beta-carotene in a staple food
	- already consumed in large quantity
## Opposition
- people are scared GMO will spread uncontrollably
	- unable to retract
	- corporate control
- long term impact, no proof that it is safe
- you can get vitamin A from non-GMOs
- profit-driven 
	- meats and leafy greens (expensive)
	- black rice (lower vitamin content)
- emphasizes reliance on cereal grains
	- dietary diversification would be preferred
		- i.e. natural sources with higher vitamin A is preferred
- yellow colour may not be acceptable
	- consumer/farmers may not want
	- in-depth research shows that once the nutritional benefits are understood, it will be accepted
