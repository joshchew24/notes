# Wasting
> [!Definition] Low weight for height
> 
>Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)
>- weight-for-height is -3 SD or more below WHO standard
>
>Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM)
>- between -2 and -3 SD
- reflects **acute** maltnutrition
	- acute: happening now and in the very recent past. i.e. very current
- generallly result of weight loss due to recent period of starvation or servere disease

### Mid upper arm circumfrence (MUAC)
- measures muscle content, correlates with total muscle mass
	- reflects protein status
	- common for field assessment
		- measurement is quick, easy, informative
	- MAM = < 12.5cm
	- SAM = < 11.5cm
- major determinants of MUAC:
	- arm muscle, subcutaneous fat
- more sensitive measure of malnutrition than low body weight
	- body weight is affected by a lot of things
	- MUAC reveals accute malnutrition quicker in its progression
- strong predictor of risk for death
- easy measurement to perform
- primarily used for children aged 6-59 months of age
	- infants have fatty arms
	- 5 year old children have leaner arms
	- i.e. arm circumference remains the same
#### Efficacy for Adolescents and Adults
- some studies support it
	- e.g. MUAC <23.5 cm in pregnant women associated with higher risk of having baby born with low birth weight in Guatemala
- no international cutoffs exist
- additional research is needed
#### Example Instruction
"**Remove any clothing** from your child's arm, and have their **arm by their side** (not up in the air). Put the band **halfway between your child's shoulder and elbow**, and insert the tip of the long end into the little slit so that it forms a loop around your child's arm.  **Gently tighten the band so that it lies flat on your child's skin** (not too tight, not too loose).  **Look at where the arrow is pointing - if it points to a number in the yellow or red areas of the band, that is a sign of malnutrition and your child should be brought to the clinic for treatment**."
## Marasmus
- severe weight loss
- body tries to conserve energy
	- reduced liver, kidney, heart activity
- use proteins from muscles and other tissues to help meet body's protein need
	- loss of >30% protein reuslts in
		- less strength for breathing
		- susceptibility to infections
		- abnormal organ function
		- death
	- due to energy deficiency, not nutritional diversity
- treatable and can be improved quickly
