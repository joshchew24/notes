# Midterm Question 22

| The Rohingya people are one of the most persecuted minority groups in the world. They have historically lived in Rakhine State, Mynamar, but Myanmar’s laws do not allow them citizenship or access to education.  For decades, they have faced extraordinary discrimination. Since August 2017, an increase in attacks against the Rohingya people has resulted in approximately 750,000 Rohingya refugees escaping from Myanmar into neighbouring Bangladesh (60% of refugees are female, 58% are children, 3% are pregnant, 7% are lactating/breastfeeding).  Approximately 25% of child refugees have severe acute malnutrition and 50% have anemia.  <br><br>  <br><br>Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, is now the largest and most densely populated refugee camp in the world, with almost 1 million people in it and neighbouring camps.  These refugee camps are not adequately equipped for their large populations: there is inadequate shelter and infrastructure, insufficient health services, and 80% of residents are entirely dependent on food aid from the United Nations World Food Programme to survive.  Among residents interviewed for a recent report, all reported violence was an issue within Cox's Bazar, 93% reported lacking access to adequate food, and 50% reported lack of health services.  Women and girls face additional challenges, including gender-based violence and forced early marriage.<br><br>  <br><br>Considering what you have learned so far in FNH 355, what do you think needs to be done to improve the nutritional status (and overall health and well-being) of the Rohingya people living as refugees in Bangladesh? <br><br>  <br><br>Use the following six terms in your response (and underline the terms when you use them): UNICEF framework, nutrition assessment, first 1000 days, priority, limitation, Canada. <br><br>  <br><br>Notes: i) terms do not need to appear in the order indicated, ii) strong answers will demonstrate evidence of your learning by including both a basic principle and a specific example from what you have learned in FNH 355 so far.<br><br>  <br><br>  <br><br>(10 marks in total for this question: 1 mark for clear, specific, appropriate use of each term; 1 mark for clear evidence of a basic principle from FNH 355 influencing your answer; 1 mark for inclusion of an appropriate specific example from the course; 2 marks for your overall answer). |

Under the UNICEF conceptual framework, we are able to determine immediate, underlying, and basic causes of malnutrition in Yemen. They can be seen as - immediate: inadequate dietary intake, infection/disease common; underlying: lack of care to children, mothers not having knowledge on nutrition, displacement of families; basic: war and conflict, corruption, political instability.

These causes are creating a huge micronutrient malnutrition problem which can be seen in the number of anemic (iron deficient) cases as well as cases of diarrhea (zinc deficient). To help reduce these impacts, education about dietary diversity must be implemented as well as attempting to provide and distribute supplementary micronutrients such as iron and zinc. However, the war and conflict is putting a limitation on the necessary distribution practices of food and supplements from the Yemen government, so other countries such as Canada must make it a priority to step in and help these countries. Canada could help by reaching towards or going above its goal of committing 0.7% of its gross national income towards helping other countries like Yemen, that are in need. Providing food aid packages, supplements, education, and helping restore peace in Yemen is something Canada can do to help.


We can first use the **UNICEF conceptual framework** to assess the causes of malnutrition of the Rohingyan refugees in Bangladesh. Some immediate causes would be inadequate dietary intake (25% of child refugees are already experiencing severe acute malnutrition) and widespread disease (50% of child refugees have anemia). The underlying causes of this are the general lack of access to adequate food (reported by 93% of Cox's Bazar residents), and health services (reported by 50%). Some basic causes are the inadequate infrastructure to support this many refugees, unfair gender roles, and the already unstable enviromment from which the refugees fled. 

The cause of the poor nutritional status of the Rohingya people are complex and work on many different levels, which can be difficult to address. Thus, it is important to **prioritize** certain efforts to improve more foundational areas. For example, increasing infrastructure in the refugee camps for both shelter and healthcare would provide safer homes these families and reduce the spread of disease by lowering the population density. Refugees could be paid to work on these projects, providing jobs and income for more families. 

In addition, the figure of 25% of children that are experiencing severe acute malnutrition is likely to be underestimated, and more **nutritional assessment** should be carried out to ensure as many cases can be addressed as possible. This can be accomplished by distributing MUAC bands for assessing wasting,
and educating mothers and families on nutrition. Most importantly, education for pregnant women and mothers of newborns should be a great **priority**, as the **first 1000 days** of a child's life (including pregnancy) are crucial to their development. One **limitation** of this is that even if women know the importance of providing adequate nutrition for their children, they may not even be able to, partly due to their lower social status, but also because they are likely to also be experiencing malnutrition themselves. A sickly mother cannot provide adequate care for her children, especially through breastfeeding. 

**Canada** can provide support for many of these efforts. As mentioned above, trying to create jobs in this community would allow the Rohingyan people to work towards self-sustenance while also improving their own environment by creating shelter, health services and reducing the spread of disease. Monetary donations from Canada could be used to pay these workers, and our government could also provide support in establishing these services. In the meantime, the Canadian government or other Canadian organizations can support these people with nutritional supplements, food or clothing donations, and humanitarian aid in the form of healthcare workers and teachers.
