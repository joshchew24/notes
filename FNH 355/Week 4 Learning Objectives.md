# Week 4 Learning Objectives
## Big Picture
1. Clearly differentiate between different forms of malnutrition, including specific forms of undernutrition and overnutrition.  For each form of malnutrition, explain its causes and consequences and give specific examples of where in the world it is more common (and why that is the case).
2. Explain, with specific examples, what is meant by the following terms: _nutrition transition_, _double burden of malnutrition_, and _hidden hunger_.  When presented with a description of a complex situation, you should be able to recognize if these are occurring in that context and justify your response.
3. Apply your developing knowledge of international nutrition to identify priorities for action to help improve nutritional status.
4. Describe the UNICEF Framework and evaluate the usefulness (advantages and disadvantages) of its recent revision.  Use the UNICEF Framework to identify causes of malnutrition and strategies to improve nutritional status.
