# Week 8 Asyncs
**Use the _What? So what? Now what?_ framework to organize and communicate your learning regarding water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).** 

Use the subheadings "What?", "So what?" and "Now what?" to organize your response and provide **2-3 relevant and informative points for each of the _What_, _So what_, and _Now what_ categories**. 

_You may decide to focus on one aspect of WASH (e.g., focus your response on sanitation alone) or you may decide to cover more than one aspect of WASH in your response._

## What?
- 2 billion people of our global population do not have access to safe drinking water
- 2.4 billion people to not have access to an "improved" sanitation facility
- ~81% of people do not wash their hands after potential contact with excreta
## So what?
- women and girls spend their days collecting enough safe drinking water for their families, resulting in less opportunities for education and work
- lack of sanitation can contaminate water supply and unsanitary conditions increase the risk of disease
- lack of hygiene increases the spread of disease 
## Now what?
- govenrment programs can establish programs and support people in these areas to build clean water supplies and sanitation facilities
- better education on proper sanitation and hygiene
