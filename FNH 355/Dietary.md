2. starting with the first item on the list, interviewer probes for details (type, amounts, additions or condiments, preparation method)
3. review details and amounts and correct any inaccuracies
### Strengths

- inexpensive
- easy for person to complete
- can be used in variety of settings
- does not alter diet
### Limitations
- under/over-reporting of certain foods
- relies on **memory**
- labour-intensive data entry
- **one recall does not represent individual's typical intake**
## Food records

## Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs)
- can deterime how often person consumes a limited number of foods
- usually 150 or fewer items
### Strengths
- can be self-administered
- machine-readable
- inexpensive

### Limitations
