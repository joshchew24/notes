# Week 3 Learning Objectives
## Big Picture
1. Differentiate between _hunger_ and _malnutrition_; clearly indicate what the terms refer to and the ways in which they are similar and/or different.
2. Describe patterns of hunger and undernutrition throughout the world (e.g., regions most affected, trends over time) and provide examples of how particular regions have achieved nutrition-related improvements.  (This week's reading will help you with this.)
3. Apply your learning to analyze and discuss the causes and consequences of undernutrition in complex real-world situations.
## Specific

2. Describe specific examples of anthropometric measurements and their strengths and limitations
3. Clearly define, describe, and evaluate: stunting, wasting, underweight, and body mass index (BMI)
4. Briefly describe how biochemical measurements can be used in nutrition assessments
6. Differentiate between clinical signs and symptoms
7. Identify and explain some useful clinical signs of malnutrition (including bilateral pitting edema)
8. Summarize the limitations of a physical examination in the assessment of nutritional status
9. Identify, describe, and evaluate the strengths and limitations of various types of dietary assessment (particularly 24-hour recalls, food records, and food frequency questionnaires)
