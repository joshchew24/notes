# Green Revolution
- increase in agricultural production due to:
	- high yield varities of cereal grains
	- irrigation
	- fertilizers (synthetic nitrogen source)
	- pesticides, herbicides (increase yield)
- 1950: producing 700 million tons of grain from 600 million hectares
- 1990: 1.9 billion tons from same amount of land
	- increase of 170%
## Benefits
- dramatic increases in yields of staple cereal grains
- reduced/eliminated need for food imports in some countries
- reduction in poverty/hunger in countries most affected
	- effects are unevenly distributed among population
## Disadvantages
- dependent on fertilizers, irrigation, chemical pesticides, mechanical plowing
- environmental effects
- expensive
	- poor farmers cannot afford equipment
	- e.g. Bangladesh, "modern" farming costs 60% more startup cost
- loss of crop diversity; depletion of soil fertility
- increasing disparity between rich landowners and tenant farmers
- increased yields were not experienced everywhere
