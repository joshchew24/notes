# Minerals
- specific, single atoms of elements that perform particular body functions
	- e.g. Zinc, Iron, Calcium, etc.
- human body contains 40+ minerals, but only 15 are essential in diet
	- others obtained through air, etc.
- single atom typically carries a charge, so minerals are quite reactive
	- constantly finding things to be back to neutral
	- combine with oppositely charged minerals to form stable compounds and become part of tissue
	- electric charge can stimulate muscle contractions, neurons, nreves
	- combine with other substances in foods to form stable compounds that are not easily absorbed
		- e.g. tea consumed with iron-rich meal reduces the bioavailability of the iron
