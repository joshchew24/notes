# Environmental Enteropathy
> 2.2.4.3 Environmental enteropathy Enteric pathogens can impair nutritional status even in the absence of symptoms such as diarrhoea. Children living in poor sanitary conditions are exposed to a high load of pathogens, especially between 6 months and 2 years of age, when they start crawling on the floor and putting objects into their mouths (Ngure et al., 2014). Chronic ingestion of pathogens can cause recurring inflammation and damage to the gut, leading to malabsorption of nutrients. This condition is often referred to as environmental enteropathy or environmental enteric dysfunction (Humphrey, 2009). Researchers suggest that environmental enteropathy may be an important cause of poor growth and may compromise the efficacy of nutritional interventions (Humphrey, 2009; Korpe & Petri, 2012). Several reviews highlighting the mounting evidence for links between unhygienic environments and gut dysfunction have recently been published (Humphrey, 2009; Korpe & Petri, 2012; Prendergast & Kelly, 2012).
