# Iron
## Statistics
- iron-deficiency affects more than 2 billion people worldwide
- severe iron deficiency results in death of 50,000 women per year in pregnancy and childbirth
- iron deficiency lowers productivity of workforces
	- estimated losses of 2% or more of GDB in worst-affected countries
- a public health condition of epidemic proportions
	- WHO
## [[Nutrition Assessments]]
- two components of ABCD are particularly important
### Biochemical
Blood test for:
- hemoglobin
	- i.e. red blood cell count
	- low levels indicate anemia
- serum ferritin
	- low levels indicate iron-deficiency caused the anemia (IDA)
### Clinical
- pale eye conjunctiva is indicative of possible IDA
- fatigue

## Consequences of Iron Deficiency
### Children
- premature birth
- low birthweight
- increased risk of infections
- death
- impaired physical growth
- impaired cognitive development
- negative impact on learning
### Adults
- Reduced productivity
- Increased likelihood of death during childbirth
	- with good iron status, may lose up to a litre of blood during birth
		- with iron-deficiency, one cup of blood loss can be fatal
	- IDA contributes to ~20% of maternal deaths
## Causes
- low dietary intake
	- what are the [[UNICEF Conceptual Framework on the Determinants of Maternal and Child Nutrition|underlying and basic causes]]?
- Poor absorption
	- physiological reasons
		- e.g. diarrhea
	- dietary reasons
		- e.g. low bioavailability in plant foods
- increased need
	- growth, pregnacny, lactation
- infections
	- malaria, HIV/AIDS, hookworms, schistosomiasis, tuberculosis
## Sources in Diet
- liver, beef, pork
- dried beans
- iron-fortified foods
- dried fruits
- spinach
- [[Lucky Iron Fish]]
- cooking tools
	- e.g. cast iron pots and pans

### Recommended Daily Intake
| North American (DRI) Recommendations | Males | Females |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 19-50 years old | 8 mg | 18 mg * |
| Vegatarian: $1.8 \times$ higher | 14 mg | 32 mg |
*\*14-18 mg of blood is lost during menstruation*
> [!info] Average
> On average, 1000kcal of a mixed diet provides ~6mg of iron. 
> Therefore, men need 1300 kcal per day, women need 3000 kcal

## Improvement Strategies
### Change Diet
- dietary diversification
- increase enhancers and reduce inhibitors of iron absorption/bio-availability
#### Types of Consumed Iron
##### Heme Iron
- part of hemoglobin (red blood cells) and myoglobin (muscles)
- better bio-availability, more absorbable
- 40% of animal food, 60% is non-heme
- ~10% of iron present in mixed diet, but ~25% of iron absorbed
##### Non-heme iron
- NOT part of hemoglobin or myoglobin
- found in both animal and plant foods
- 100% of plant food
- eggs, dairy
#### Other Dietary Factors that Affect Iron Absorption
