# Energy
- fuels three processes, basal metabolism, physical activity, and dietary thermogenesis
- food energy is measured using bomb calorimeter
## Bomb calorimeter
- food burned in container surrounded by water
- 1 kcal = amount of energy required to raise 1kg water by 1$\degree$C
## Basal Metabolism
- energy required to maintain normal body functions at rest
- 60-75% of total kcal needs
### Body Fat
- less metabolically active
- accounts for <20% of energy used for basal metabolism
### Brain, liver, kidneys, muscle
- more metabolically active
- accounts for ~80% of energy used for basal metabolism
## Physical Activity
- energy needed for muscular work 
## Dietary thermogenesis
- energy used to ingest and digest food
### Peristalsis
- wavelike muscular contraction/relaxation oft he intestine that propel contents forward
## Digestion
- process of turning food into substances that can _be absorbed by body_
- mechanical and chemical
	- chewing vs stomach acid
## Absorption
- process by which nutrients and other substances are transferred from the digestive system _into body fluids_ for transport throughout the body
## Where can we get energy?
- [[Macronutrients]]
- Alcohol
