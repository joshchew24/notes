# Vitamin A
- deficiency is one of the **most widespread and serious nutritional issues for young children**
	- affects ~1/3 children aged 6-59 months (~8 years old)
- key nutrient for embryo development
	- immune system
	- vision
- found in many foods
	- green leafy vegetables
	- yellow vegetables and fruits
	- dairy products
	- fish
	- eggs
- **leading cause of preventable blindness** in children globally
	- can begin as 'night blindness' and progress to permanent blindness
- **exacerbates serious disease and illness**
	- increased maternal and childhood mortality
	- compromises immune system activity
- data is sporadic and less consistent
	- generally, not all cases of deficiency result in night blindness
		- more common in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia
- preschool children are most vulnerable
## Supplementation
- many countries provide supplements through high-dose capsules
	- defined as sufficient if a child receives at least two capsules per year
- huge impact with little cost
## Sources
- variety of plant and animal foods
- industrialized countries:
	- ~2/3 of dietary vitamin A from animal sources as preformed vitamin A
		- e.g. liver, milk products, egg, fish
		- in animal-sources. 70-90% bioavailable
- developing world:
	- mostly provitamin A from carotenoids in plant foods
		- e.g. yellow and orange fruit and vegetables, dark leafy greens, red palm oil
		- carotenoids in plant-source foods: 5-65% bioavailable

	- serum retinol -> tissue and plasma depletion
- [[Clinical]]
	- night blindness, bitot's spots
		- very specific to vitamin A
	- frequent respiratory or intestinal infections
		- not specific to vitamin A
- [[Dietary]]
	- food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)

## Consequences
### Xerophthalmia
- night blindness
	- earliest sign, specific, sensitive
	- very treatable and rapidly
- see [[Clinical#Eyes]]
### Compromised immunity
- "nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency disorder"
- mucous barries that line gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts are not as effective
	- i.e. any system that is open to the outside
- impaired immune response
### Increased Infection
- affected individuals are predisposed to severe infection
- respiratatory infection, infectious diarrhea, dysentery, measles, HIV, malaria
### Increased morbidity and mortality
- 35% of all deaths among children age <5 in Mozamabique were due to VAD
## Prevention
- education and promoting awareness targeting women
- promote breastfeeding
- dietary diversification
	- preomote vitamin-A rich foods
- selective crop breeding
- fortification
	- sugar, oil, margarine
	- to be successful, fortified foods should provide at least 15% of the daily kcal intake for the target group
		- rule of thumb, salt is an exception
	- typically need to be combined with other strategies
	- need to be monitored
- increase distribution of [[#Supplementation|supplements]]
- local household/community food production
	- i.e. home/community garden
