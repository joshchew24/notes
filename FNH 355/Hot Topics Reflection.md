# Hot Topics Reflection
## Reflection
As I mentioned in the discussion, I have a fairly pessimistic view on the role played by political leaders, governments, and big corporations, and their impact on food accessibility and prices. I feel like there are a few mega-corporations that hold a monopoly on most industries, and their immense wealth is used to influence government policies to further their own profits. My most important learning from this discussion is that I can be more hopeful and optimistic about the state of our society and the direction we are headed. This came from hearing more perspectives on this issue, and learning more about the efficacy of food banks, and the prospects of new social programs and government policies that are meant to tackle this issue. There was a chart that showed a decrease in household food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic, which made me think of the different income support programs that were in place at the time (e.g. CERB, CESB, etc.). To me, this suggests that UBI programs have the potential to greatly reduce food insecurity issues. I can't remember who, but someone in the discussion raised a good counterpoint that people were likely spending less overall, which increased their capability to purchase groceries. However, I would argue that if someone can't afford to buy food, their spending habits would be relatively unaffected by the pandemic, since they are unlikely to spend money on non-essentials in the first place (e.g. travel, luxury goods, entertainment, etc.).
