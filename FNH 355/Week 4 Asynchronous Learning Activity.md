# Week 4 Asynchronous Learning Activity
1. Where in the world is undernutrition and overnutrition most common?
	- undernutrition: sub-saharan africa, south asia
	- overnutrition: USA, UK, Brazil
1. What are the trends over time with respect to under- and overnutrition?
	- undernutrition: was falling but rising more in recent years
	- overnutrition: steadily rising
1. Compare and contrast the prevalence of undernutrition and overnutrition by selecting 3-5 countries of interest to you and hovering over those countries in each of the figures to view the proportion undernourished and the proportion overweight or obese currently (and trends over time).  What do you notice?  Any surprises?  What could explain what you observe (in other words, can you generate a hypothesis to explain what you is happening in those locations)?

1. Based on your exploration of Figure 1 and Figure 2 on this week's Learning Module page, describe the pattern(s) you observed in terms of the proportions of people throughout the world living with A) undernourishment (shown in Figure 1) and B) overweight/obesity (shown in Figure 2) -- both currently and in terms of trends over time (i.e., historical data). 
	- In general, it seems that the proportion of undernourished people is much lower than the proportion of overweight and obese people. The share of undernourished people seems to be less than 25%, whereas the overnourished people are even higher than 60% in some countries. 
2. **What causes and consequences of Hagirso's childhood undernutrition do you observe?**  Identify (at least) 2 causes and (at least) 2 consequences of Hagirso's undernutrition that you observed in the presentation.  _Briefly explain each._
	- Causes: Ethiopia experienced a largescale famine in 2003, resulting in very limited access to nutrition. Hagirso's mother was malnourished when she gave birth, resulting in Hagirso being born underweight.
	- Consequences: Hagirso experienced SAM for many years, resulting in chronic malnutrition. His physical and cognitive growth were both stunted, and he started education much later than usual and progresses at a slower pace. His dreams of being a doctor are unlikely to ever come true.
