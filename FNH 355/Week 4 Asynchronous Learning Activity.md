# Week 4 Asynchronous Learning Activity
1. Where in the world is undernutrition and overnutrition most common?
	- undernutrition: sub-saharan africa, south asia
	- overnutrition: USA, UK, Brazil
1. What are the trends over time with respect to under- and overnutrition?
	- undernutrition: was falling but rising more in recent years
	- overnutrition: steadily rising
1. Compare and contrast the prevalence of undernutrition and overnutrition by selecting 3-5 countries of interest to you and hovering over those countries in each of the figures to view the proportion undernourished and the proportion overweight or obese currently (and trends over time).  What do you notice?  Any surprises?  What could explain what you observe (in other words, can you generate a hypothesis to explain what you is happening in those locations)?

1. Based on your exploration of Figure 1 and Figure 2 on this week's Learning Module page, describe the pattern(s) you observed in terms of the proportions of people throughout the world living with A) undernourishment (shown in Figure 1) and B) overweight/obesity (shown in Figure 2) -- both currently and in terms of trends over time (i.e., historical data).  
2. **What causes and consequences of Hagirso's childhood undernutrition do you observe?**  Identify (at least) 2 causes and (at least) 2 consequences of Hagirso's undernutrition that you observed in the presentation.  _Briefly explain each._
