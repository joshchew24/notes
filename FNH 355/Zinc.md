# Zinc
## Statistics
- contributes to growth failure and weakened immunity in children
	- needed for grwoth and recovery
- contributes to 800,000 child deaths per year
	- resulting from diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria
- deficiency can affect central nervous system, skeleton, digestive system, immune system, and other system
- globally very common, particularly in lower-income countries
	- cereal-dominant diets with low protein
## Current Action
- research shows zinc supplements can help treat diarrhea and reduce diarrheal mortality by 50%
- WHO recommends 10-14 days zinc supplementation for children with acute diarrhea episode
	- this recommendation has not been widely adopted
- to treat diarrhea, need
	- oral rehydration salts (ORS)
		- electrolytes
	- zinc supplements
		- reduces diarrhea severity, duration, and risk of reinfection
## ColaLife
- piggy-back Coca-Cola supply chain to get ORS and zinc to remote rural areas
- 10 "kit yamoyos" fit in a crate of coke
- during operational trial in Zambia
	- proportion of children with diarrhea treated with ORS and zinc 
		- at baseline: <1%
		- after 1 year of trial: <45%
	- 93% mixed ORS correctly
	- 4% of kits were actually transported in coke crates
		- kit's success resulted from creating effective value chain
			- design -> manufacture -> assembly -> storage -> distribution -> purchase by mother
			- every step adds value and generates profit for organization or individual
