# Anthopometry
- measurement of **physical dimensions** and gross composition of the body
- key measurements of gross body size:
	- height, weight, mid upper arm circumference (MUAC)
		- results compared to international standard values
## WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study
- tracked growth of children raised in various countries but in stablle homes
- created international reference values for growth
- infants breastfed
- covers 24 month period
	- i.e. first 1000 days
	- important period for nutrition intervention
		- undernutrition has significant and long-lasting consequences during this time of deveopment
		- cost-effective (large benefit derived from relatively small investment)
		- undernutrition-caused deaths during this time are preventable

## Wasting
> [!Definition] Low weight for height
- reflects **acute** maltnutrition
	- acute: happening now and in the very recent past. i.e. very current
- generallly result of weight loss due to recent period of starvation or servere disease
- Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)
	- weight-for-height is -3 SD or more below WHO standard
- Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM)
	- between -2 and -3 SD

### Mid upper arm circumfrence (MUAC)
- measures muscle content, correlates with total muscle mass
	- reflects protein status
	- common for field assessment
		- measurement is quick, easy, informative
	- MAM = < 12.5cm
	- SAM = < 11.5cm
- major determinants of MUAC:
	- arm muscle, subcutaneous fat
- more sensitive measure of malnutrition than low body weight
	- body weight is affected by a lot of things
	- MUAC reveals accute malnutrition quicker in its progression
- strong predictor of risk for death
- easy measurement to perform
- primarily used for children aged 6-59 months of age
	- infants have fatty arms
	- 5 year old children have leaner arms
	- i.e. arm circumference remains the same
#### Efficacy for Adolescents and Adults
- some studies support it
	- e.g. MUAC <23.5 cm in pregnant women associated with higher risk of having baby born with low birth weight in Guatemala
- no international cutoffs exist
- additional research is needed
