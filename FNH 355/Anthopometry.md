# Anthopometry
- measurement of **physical dimensions** and gross composition of the body
- key measurements of gross body size:
	- height, weight, mid upper arm circumference (MUAC)
		- results compared to international standard values
## WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study
- tracked growth of children raised in various countries but in stablle homes
- created international reference values for growth
- infants breastfed
- covers 24 month period
	- i.e. first 1000 days
	- important period for nutrition intervention
		- undernutrition has significant and long-lasting consequences during this time of deveopment
		- cost-effective (large benefit derived from relatively small investment)
		- undernutrition-caused deaths during this time are preventable

|  | How to identify? | What does it mean? | Why does it matter? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Wasting <br>(Low weight for height) | MUAC | acute malnutrition | risk of death |
| Stunting<br>(Low height for age) | Measure height | chronic malnutrition | poor physiological and cognitive development |
| Underweight<br>(Low weight for age) | BMI (for adults) | combination malnutrition | general health problems |
