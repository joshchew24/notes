- **What proportion of the population currently has insufficient food consumption?**  _(Look at the "Food Security" section on the left side of the screen.)_  Figure out the percentage of the population affected (by dividing the number of "people with insufficient food consumption" by the "population" and multiplying that result by 100. 
	- DRC: 42.5/105.9 = 40.1%
	- myanmar: 13.2/53.7 == 24.6%
- **Has the number of people with insufficient food consumption increased or decreased in the recent past?**  _(Look at the number to the immediate right of "people with insufficient food consumption as well as the figures under "Food security trends," lower down on the left side of the screen.)_  What are the trends - stable, increasing, or decreasing?

- **How would you describe regional differences in food insecurity and coping throughout the country?**  _(Hover over different regions of the country on the map, and the proportion/number of people with insufficient food consumption and crisis levels of coping will be shown.)_
	- DRC: some regions as low as 20%, most regions very high, as bad as 60%
	- myanmar: most regions moderately high (20-30%), some regions closer to 40%

A) Identify the two countries that you selected to explore in greater detail using the World Food Programme's Hunger Map. 

B) Reflecting on the data provided for each country (related to the questions you were asked to consider), **what insights did you gain regarding nutrition-related challenges in each country** -- both in terms of the current situation and in terms of vulnerability to future challenges?  Be specific!  _Limit your response to 4-6 sentences.  (2 marks)_
- in DRC, the proportion of the population experiencing insufficient food consumption is very high across most regions, with a prevalence of over 40%. Although this affects a huge percentage of the population, this figure is on a downwards trend, seeing a 0.54 million decrease from 1 month ago, and a 0.05 million decrease from 3 months ago. Because 
- In Myanmar, the proportion of the population experiencing insufficient food consumption is lower than the DRC, although still a considerable amount of 24.6%. The worst affected region is at 37%, with most regions hovering between 20-30%


C) Think about what you have learned thus far in FNH 355...
