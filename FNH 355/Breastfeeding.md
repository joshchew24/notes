# Breastfeeding
worldwide, 42% of infants are exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months 
## 1-6-24 model
- intiate breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth
- exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months
- continue breastfeeding with [[Complementary Foods|complementary foods]] for 24+ months
- see also [[WHO Breastfeeding Recommendations]]
## Benefits
- reduced risk of infant mortality
	- non-breastfed infants in developing countries 6-10 times more likely to die in first months of life
	- diarrhea and pneumonia are more severe in non-breastfed infants
	- compared to children aged 6-23 months who received breast milk, those who were _not_ breastfed were approximately twice as likely to die

| How infants were fed from 0-5 months | Relative Risk (RR) for mortality from any cause (95% confidence interval) | Relative Risk (RR) for infection-related mortality (95% confidence interval) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Exclusively breastfed | **1.0** | **1.0** |
| Predominantly breastfed | **1.5** (1.1-1.9) | **1.7** (1.2-2.5) |
| Partially breastfed | **2.8** (1.6-5.0) | **4.6** (3.0-7.1) |
| Not breastfed | **14.4** (6.1-34.0) | **8.7** (3.2-24.0) |
- reduced risk of postpartum hemorrhage if mother can breastfeed shortly after delivery
	- triggers hormonal response to contract uterus and expel the placenta
- increased birth spacing
	- an interval of at least 24 months between a live birth and the next conception reduces risk of negative outcomes for mother and infant
	- breastfeeding can increase birth spacing by causing "lactational amenorrhea"
	- exclusive breastfeeding can give a woman 98% protection against pregnancy for 6 months
		- if her baby feeds frequently day and night, and is not given any other food, drinks, or a pacifier
		- important to breastfeed at night
## Composition
|  | Breast Milk (100mL) |
| ---- | ---- |
| Energy | 163 - 175 kcal |
| Protein | 2.25 - 3 g (7% of kcal) |
| Fat | 8 - 9 g (46% of kcal) |
| Carbohydrate | 16.8 - 19.5 g (45% of kcal) |
| Vitamins | Sufficient amounts, except vitamin D (and vitamin K) |
| Minerals | Low in iron (but bioavailability high, and infant stores will last ~6 months) |
| Anti-infective factors | Immunoglobulins, white blood cells, lysozyme, lactoferrin, etc. |
| Other bioactive factors | Lipase, growth factors (e.g., promote growth and development of intestinal tract), laxative factors |
### Changes over time
- the composition of the breastmilk changes to match the needs of the infant
- Colostrum
	- secreted for first 2-3 days after delivery
	- Concentrated, very nutritious, mild laxative , contains growth factors and antibodies
	- infant will consume only ~1 tsp of colostrum in a feeding
	- some communities incorrectly perceive colostrum to be "immature, dirty milk, and therefore harmful to their infants"
- Transitional milk
	- until infant ~2 weeks old
- Mature milk
	- from 2 weeks to ~6 months
- Extended lactation
	- beyond 6 months
#### Prelacteal feed
- anything given to infant before initiating breastfeeding
- believed to be laxatives, cleansing agents, rehydrating agents, a way to clear the meconium
- 43% of infants given something other than breast milk in first 3 days of life
#### Changing within a feed
when feeding an infant, the first breast should be "drained" of breast milk before the other breast is offered
- foremilk - waterly
- hindmilk - high fat
	- primarily in the hindmilk
	- more energy dense

## Factors Affecting if a Woman Breastfeeds
- opportunity to feed right away
- supportive sociocultural context
- direct information and support
