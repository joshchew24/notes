1. What are the strengths of MUAC? What are its limitiations? Identify and briefly explain 2 strengths and 2 limitations of using MUAC to assess nutritional status. Given these, do you think it is an effective tool? Explain.
	- MUAC is easy and quick to perform, thus not requiring special training or education. This is important as communities where undernutrition is more common are typically limited in access to resources. Using MUAC to assess nutritional status is cheap and simple, making it easily accessible for these communities. MUAC is also a more sensitive indicator of malnutrition compared to low body weight, thus providing a more accurate assessment and lower risk of a misprognosis. However, MUAC is only used for children aged 6-59 months. This seems especially limiting because it's not a reliable indicator for younger infants, which is a crucial period of development. Also, MUAC only predicts undernutrition, but does not indicate overnutrition. While this may be on the other end of the spectrum of malnutrition, there are many negative health effects that come with obesity that potentially arise from this same stage in a child's life. Given these, I still believe MUAC is an effective tool for addressing undernutrition. Although it has some limitations, it is a great "canary test" for predicting undernutrition for a wide age range of children, and is simple and cost-effective for impoverished communities to use.
