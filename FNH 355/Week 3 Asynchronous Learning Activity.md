# Week 3 Asynchronous Learning Activity
1. What are the strengths of MUAC? What are its limitiations? Identify and briefly explain 2 strengths and 2 limitations of using MUAC to assess nutritional status. Given these, do you think it is an effective tool? Explain.
	- MUAC is easy and quick to perform, thus not requiring special training or education. This is important as communities where undernutrition is more common are typically limited in access to resources. Using MUAC to assess nutritional status is cheap and simple, making it easily accessible for these communities. MUAC is also a more sensitive indicator of malnutrition compared to low body weight, thus providing a more accurate assessment and lowering the risk of a misdiagnosis. However, MUAC is only used for children aged 6-59 months. This seems especially limiting because it's not a reliable indicator for younger infants, which is a crucial period of development. Also, MUAC only predicts undernutrition, but does not indicate overnutrition. While this may be on the other end of the spectrum of malnutrition, there are many negative health effects that come with obesity that potentially arise from this same stage in a child's life. Given these, I still believe MUAC is an effective tool for addressing undernutrition. Although it has some limitations, it is a great "canary test" for predicting undernutrition for a wide age range of children, and is simple and cost-effective for impoverished communities to use. 

2. 
	- A) Based on what was shown or described in the video, what are some of the causes of malnutrition in Nepal?  List as many causes as you can, based on the information provided in the video.  _(Simply listing various factors is sufficient at this point; you do not need to explain each factor)_
		- difficult geographical location (steep mountains and valleys isolate communities)
		- harsh winter weather 
		- mothers work in the fields during the day, so no one is home to feed the children
		- poor hygiene and sanitation
		- not enough food from harvest, need to buy but can't afford
		- lack of education, some mothers don't even know their children are malnourished
		- healthcare centres are many hours away, hard to consistently receive treatment and checkups
		- caste system, lower castes are landless and significantly poorer
	- B) Of the factors you identified above, which factor do you think is the most important?  (In other words, in your view, what is the _biggest cause of malnutrition_ in Nepal?)  Briefly explain.  _(Limit your response to 2-3 sentences)_
