# Week 2 Asynchronous Learning Activity
**A) What stands out to you with respect to the top sources of sugar in Canadian children's diets?** Â 
I am surprised that milk contributes so much to a child's sugar intake, especially relative to other individual sources, Another thing that I found interesting is that milk is not very sweet, indicating that its sugar content may not be that high. 
**B) What might be the pros and cons (or advantages and disadvantages) of this pattern of sugar consumption?**
Pros:  Assuming that milk has a relatively low sugar content, this indicates that milk generally composes a larger portion of a child's general diet. I think this is a good thing because milk is healthier than sugary drinks like soda and fruit juice.
Cons: A large percentage of a child's sugar intake still comes from high sugar processed goods. Altogether, fruit juice, confectionary, fruit drinks, and soft drinks contribute 34% of a child's intake, which is higher than milk.


**C) Given what you are learning about basic nutrition, what advice might you give to parents of young children?**
Focus on providing a balanced diet with proportions based on the AMDR recommendations. Health trends that completely avoid sugar or carbohydrates are not necessarily healthy, especially not for young children.
