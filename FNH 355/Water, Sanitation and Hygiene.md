## [[Water]]
- 663 million people worldwide do not have access to an "improved" source of drinking water
	- "improved" sources are not necessarily clean water
		- piped water into dwelling
		- piped water to yard/plot
		- public tap
		- tubewell or borehole
		- protected dug well
		- protected spring
		- rainwater collected and stored until used
	- but, even "improved" sources can be contaminated
		- approx 1/11
	- more than 2 billion people do not have access to safe drinking water
- worldwide, women and girls spend an estimated 200 million hours every day collecting hours
	- i.e. 8.3 million (24-hour) days
## [[Sanitation]]
- i.e. where people excrete
- 2.4 billion people worldwide do not have access to an "improved" sanitation facility
	- i.e. 1/3 people with 70% in rural areas
	- 13% do "open defecation"
- e.g.
	- flush toilet
	- piped sewer system
	- septic tank
	- flush/pour flush to pit latrine
	- pit latrine with slab
	- composting toilet
- "no toilet, no bride" == "no loo, no I do"
	- social pressure to combat open defecation
	- slogan disseminated via radio, posters, etc. as part of large media compaign in Haryana state
	- encouraged girls' families to demand a latrine of boys' families before marriage
	- appears to have increased latrine ownership among families with boys of marriage age by ~20% by 2004
		- ~700000 more toilets in the state in 2008 versus 2004
## Hygiene
- i.e. washing hands
- estimated that only 19% of global population wash their hands after potential contact with excreta (urine/feces)
