# Carbohydrates
> [!important] 4 kcal/g
- carbohydrate family includes three types of chemical substances
	- simple sugars
	- complex carbohydrates ("starch")
	- fibre
- 40-80% of total food intake
	- depends on locale, economic status, cultural considerations
	- avg 60%
- body can only use one simple sugar for energy: **glucose**
- adequate intake prevents **protein** breakdown for energy
### Staple foods
> [!important] Provides ~60% of the world's food energy
- e.g. maize (corn), rice, wheat
- eaten regularly, in relatively large amounts
	- supply a large amount of dietary energy and nutrients
- cannot supply all the nutrients
	- need ***dietary diversity***
### Simple sugars
- small molecules that require little or no digestion
1. **mono**saccharides (one molecule)
	- e.g. glucoes, fructose, galactose
	- can be absorbed "as is"
		- do need to be broken down by digestive enzymes
2. **di**saccharides (two molecules)
	- combinations of monosaccharides
		- sucrose (glucose + fructose)
		- maltose (glucose + glucose)
		- lactose (glucose + galactose)
	- must be digested into monosaccharides before absorption from GI tract
### Complex Carbohydrates
- **polysaccharides**
1. **starches**
	- glucose molecules linked together
2. **glycogen**
	- storage form of glucose in liver and muscle
		- "animal strach"
	- negligible
3. dietary **fibre**
	- polysaccharides that can't be digested
		- humans lack the digestive enzymes to break them down
		- i.e. doesn't provide energy for humans
	- [[Famine foods]]
>[!important] Canadians get ~21% of their kcal from sugar
