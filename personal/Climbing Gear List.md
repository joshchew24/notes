# Climbing Gear List
this is what i’ve been using, assuming you also want to rappel

summary:
2 120cm slings (one nylon and one dyneema)
7 locking carabiners (3 HMS/pear, 2 D-shape, the other 2 can be any style)
1 150cm static cord
1 ATC or equivalent


here’s a breakdown:

anchor:
one 120cm sling (i like nylon because they’re easier to untie, you can also use cordelette)
two HMS carabiners
two D-shape carabiners

personal tether:
one 120cm sling (i use a dyneema one)
one locking carabiner
this is a cheap but safe tether, there are more expensive options that are more convenient that I can send you if interested. this system can also double as a rappel extension

rappel:
one tube style belay device (i.e. ATC)
one 150cm static cord (not too sure the specs, this is for friction hitch)
one HMS carabiner for your ATC
one locking carabiner for the friction hitch


in total you'll need 7 biners
1: you can buy an ATC that comes with an HMS carabiner

2, 3, 4: if you're buying black diamond carabiners, you can buy one 3-pack of Hotforge Screwgates. they're D-shaped. use two for attaching the anchor to the bolts, and one for your personal tether. 

5, 6: buy two (ideally the same ones) HMS/pear-shaped ones. (for clipping rope into anchor)

7: can be any style, but I use a smaller d-shape one because it’s easier to manage when you have a lot of gear on your belay loop. this is for the friction hitch
