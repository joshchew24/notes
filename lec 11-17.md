# lec 11-17

problem constraints 2:
each copmonent found one at a time


# hierarchical naming
contents of the directory are a mapping

pathnames to inumbers are cached 

# ***root directory has designated/fixed inode number == 2***
if we know root, we can find any file

folder is just a file with directory entries
entries map a filename to an inumber

### walking directory path
if this is the last component of the path, we're done

# directory example
something needs to keep track of which inodes are valid/in-use
inode 2 is root directory


exercise: open /usr/lib/libc.a
100, (2) 200, (16) 102 204, (9) 101 203, (55) 106


# link count
empty: 2
parent and self-ref
3 sub: 5
inode numbers only make sense in the context of their own file system
