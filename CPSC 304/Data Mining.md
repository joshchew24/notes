# Data Mining
## Learning Goals
- define the term knowledge discovery
- explain the general steps involved in the knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process
- comment on the benefits and challenges that data mining has when dealing with imperfect data quality, especially in large datasets (e.g., data mining can point out anomalies (outliers), optimize the use of human time, detect patterns in data (including patterns that are there just by chance).
- explain the value of finding frequent itemsets and association rules. provide some real-world examples of their use (e.g. retailing, biology)
- explain the purpose of association rules
- apply the Apriori Algorithm and compute frequent itemsets and association rules (by hand, for a small dataset)
