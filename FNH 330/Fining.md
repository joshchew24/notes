## Fining
- adding an agent to precipitate debris/compounds in suspension or solution
- Kieselsol - colloidal/bitter compounds
- Egg albumen - tannins (astringent)
- Bentonite (a clay) - proteins (haze)
- Activated charcoal, PVPP - brown/oxidized pigments
- fining should be performed with trials
	- lowest possible levels of agents to avoid stripping aroma, mouthfeel, flavour
