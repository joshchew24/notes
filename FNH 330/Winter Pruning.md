# Winter Pruning
- removes excess wood (90% of buds) to re-establish vine training system
- maintains training system that optimizes light interception
	- minimizes shading
	- targets certain yield, quantity, quality of grapes
- timing influences bud growth
	- later pruning delays bud growth, helps to avoid early spring frost incidents
## Spur Pruning Example

## Balanced Pruning
1. assess vigor of representative vines
	1. randomly select representative vines (e.g. for 500 vines, sample 15)
	2. prune 1-year-old cane wood to leave 10 main buds per vine
	3. weigh total prunings for each vine and take the average
2. prune the rest of the vineyard
	- for [[Bilateral Cordon System]] and [[Double Guyot System]]
		- leave 10 buds (minimum) + 10 additional fruitful buds per pound of prunings
		- maximum of 40 buds depending on variety
	- number of fruitful buds are adjusted to balance vine's estimated capacity to ripen the crop
