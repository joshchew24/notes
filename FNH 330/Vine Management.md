# Vine Management
## Vine Training Systems
- orientation and positioning of trunk, permanent wood/canes and shoots
- shoot positioning
	- arranging shoots into the correct orientation
### Choosing a Training System
- depends on
	- vine vigour (soil x rootstock + variety)
	- climate
	- site terrain
	- cost
- in the right terroir, some systems offer advantages
	- manging canopy for cultivar, mesoclimate, soil
	- potential for enhanced wine grape yield and/or quality
- must be sustainable
	- low maintenance and economical
	- depends on terrain, availability of labour
- machine or hand harvesting
- wine quality requirements and achievability
	- some systems are expensive but higher grape yield and quality
### [[Double Guyot System]]
### [[Bilateral Cordon System]]
### [[Smart-Henry System]]
### Bush/Umbrella System
- no trellis
- head-pruned to spurs canopy is bush/umbrella-shaped
- low yielding
- less expensive to establish
	- no trellis/irrigation

### Overhead-pergola System
- spur renewal and trellised
- expensive
- high yield
- protection from hot sun

### Horizontally Divided Canopy System
- allows higher vine vigour (more leaf/shoot growth)
- more fruit (higher yield)
- balances vegetative:fruit ratio
- maintains wine grape quality
