- trunk with 2 one-year old renewal ("mother") canes
- vertical shoot positioning (VSP)
- each "mother-cane" has 5-30 compound buds
	- produce new fruiting shoots in the following growing season
#### Cane Renewal
- each cane is replaced after it produces a harvest
##### Pros
- more fruitful, larger crop
##### Cons
- less suited to mechanical harvest
- harder to prune
