# White Winemaking Steps
## Sorting
- material other than grapes (MOG) such as leaves/sticks may be removed
- underripe or rotten grapes removed
- degree of sorting depends on quality of wine desired, winery size
- grapes are still in clusters (unless mechnically harvested)
## Destemming
- grapes mechanically separated from stems
- more efficientL press more grapes at once
- stems add astringency and bitterness
## Crushing
- better yield of juice from white grapes
- enzymes may be added to enhance juice extraction
- SO$_2$ may be added at this stage

## Pectinase Enzyme Addiction after Crushing
- enzymes: biological molecules (proteins) that catalyze chemical reactions
	- extracted from fungi
- pectanises
	- breaks down pectin molecules
		- allow for better settling/juice clarification
	- weaken grape cell walls
		- allow gentler pressing to extract juice
		- gentle press, fewer bitter skin/seed compounds are extracted
## Chilling
- the [[Must]] may go through a heat exchanger to cool the must
	- discourages oxiation and wild fermentation
- more common in larger production lines

## Pressing
- must be pumped into a pneumatic/membrane press
	- also basket/vertical screw press
	- feet
	- plunger type press
- free-run juice is collected
	- juice produced during crushing/destemming runs off by gravity
	- usually higher quality
- usually two or three presses
	- first press juice is gently pressed off the skins/seeds
		- this and free-run juice often mixed, used for higher quality wine
		- free of bittered oils and tannins
	- hard press juic is kept separate from first press and free-run
		- higher in solids
		- more vegetal
		- more bitter
		- lower quality
	- juice is collected and cooled
![[Pasted image 20250206164143.png]]
- pomace/marc
	- leftover skins/seeds "press cake"
	- all juice has been extracted
	- can be composted
	- or add water/sugar to ferment, make eau-de-vie or grappa

## Preparing the Must - Juice Clarification
- remove solids from wine that can impart vegetal aromas
- juice pumped into settling tanks (refrigerated)
- juice topped with CO$_2$ or N$_2$ to deter oxidation/microbial growth (if there's head space in the tank)
- settling agents (e.g. hydrated silicon dioxide) often added to help clarify the juice
- settling occurs for about 24 hours
![[Pasted image 20250206164617.png]]![[Pasted image 20250206164635.png]]
- take clean juice off sediment and move to a new tank
	- "racked off", leave grape cell debris (stabilizes juice)
	- avoids development of reduced-sulfur taints
- large wineries can use centrifuge
## Pre-fermentation Adjustments
### Chaptalization
- addition of sugar to increase final ABV
	- if necessary and legal
- 17 g/L sugar raises ABV by 1%
- can also use sucrose (if alloewd) or rectified concentrated grape must
- ![[Pasted image 20250223174840.png]]
### Balancing pH
#### Low pH (high acidity)
- acid level is > 10 g/L
- pH < 3.1
- add calcium carbonate, Acidex (potassium bicarbonate + potassium bitartrate)
	- basic compounds neutralize acid
	- acidity tends to go down during fermentation, can be adjusted afterwards
- blend with lower acidity juice
- **amelioration**
	- acidic juice diluted with water, sugar added before fermentation
	- used in low quality economy wines
#### High pH (low acidity)
- acid level is < 6-8 g/L
- pH > 3.4
- add tartaric acid to low-acid juice
## Fermentation
- fermented mainly using **wine yeast: *Saccharomyces cerevisiae***
	- can tolerate high ethanol concentrations
	- converts sugars in grape juice into ethanol, CO$_2$ and heat
	- ![[Pasted image 20250223175923.png]]
- temperature controlled at **12-18ËšC to preserve aromas**
	- higher temps cause white wine to lose aromas, create off aromas
	- tanks may have refrigerated jackets
- must is monitored closely for problems
	- once/twice a day tasting, analysis
- fermentation may start slowly, should be rapid once *Saccharomyces* population increases
- continues for a number of days to about 2 weeks
- CO$_2$ escapes through one-way valve to avoid pressure build up
- complete when all sugar is consumed (<2 g/L)
	- winemaker can stop fermentation if off-dry to sweet wine is desired
- wine is chilled, SO$_2$ added, then settled and racked off [[Lees|Gross lees]] (grape solids and particulates) 
### Types
#### Inoculated Fermentation
- single strain of *S. cerevisiae* is added (10$^6$ to 10$^7$ cells per mL)
- most common fermentation type
- fast and reliable
	- high numbers of *S. cerevisiae* out-compete other microorganisms, avoiding spoilage
#### Uninoculated/Spontaneous Fermentation
- **yeast on grapes** in winery conduct fermentation
- may produce more aromatic complexity
	- yeast variety yields different aroma compounds
- risk of spoilage
##### Fermentation Microorganisms
- grape surface contains microbes on the **waxy cuticle** (the **bloom**)
	- yeasts/fungi: ~100 - 10,000 cells
	- bacteria: ~100,000 cells
	- increased by 2 orders of magnitude in damaged berries
- wild yeasts (non-*Saccharomyces*)
	- *Kloeckera apiculata*
		- dominates until 4-5% EtOH (alcohol) kills it off
		- produces ethyl acetate
		- can create taints (glue, nail polish remover)
	- after fermentation, ***Pichia* yeasts** forms a film on wine surface
		- imparts oxidized/acetaldehyde aroma
- some *Saccharomyces* present at low levels from grapes and winery
	- as alcohol exceeds 4%, it begins to dominate (tolerates alcohol well)
		- often the only yeast at $\geq$ 10% ABV
## Optional Steps: Post-fermentation
### Post-fermentation treatments
- add **glucosidase enzymes ($\beta$-glucosidases)** 
	- increases volatile aromas in aromatic white wines
	- ![[Pasted image 20250226230308.png]]\
	- sugar chains detached -> more volatile aromas
### Batonnage (lees stirring)
- in some (non-aromatic) whites, wine is left on dead yeast ([[Lees|Fine lees]]) in
