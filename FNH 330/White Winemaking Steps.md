# White Winemaking Steps
## Sorting
- material other than grapes (MOG) such as leaves/sticks may be removed
- underripe or rotten grapes removed
- degree of sorting depends on quality of wine desired, winery size
- grapes are still in clusters (unless mechnically harvested)
## Destemming
- grapes mechanically separated from stems
- more efficientL press more grapes at once
- stems add astringency and bitterness
## Crushing
- better yield of juice from white grapes
- enzymes may be added to enhance juice extraction
- SO$_2$ may be added at this stage

## Pectinase Enzyme Addiction after Crushing
- enzymes: biological molecules (proteins) that catalyze chemical reactions
	- extracted from fungi
- pectanises
	- breaks down pectin molecules
		- allow for better settling/juice clarification
	- weaken grape cell walls
		- allow gentler pressing to extract juice
		- gentle press, fewer bitter skin/seed compounds are extracted
## Chilling
- the [[Must]] may go through a heat exchanger to cool the must
	- discourages oxiation and wild fermentation
- more common in larger production lines

## Pressing
- must be pumped into a pneumatic/membrane press
	- also bas
- free-run juice is collected
	- juice produced during crushing/destemming runs off by gravity
	- usually higher quality
