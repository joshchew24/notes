# Canopy Management
## Shoot Thinning
- removes secondary shoots (from compound buds)
- ensures good shoot spacing
	- better airflow, reduced humidity, reduced disease pressure
- done in late spring
## Summer Pruning/Hedging
- removes secondary shoots
- improves light/air penetration
## Basal Leaf Removal
- remove basal leaves
- expose grapes to sun/air circulation
- lower relative humidity (RH) around berries (less disease)
- improve application of fungicides
- increase skin thickness, flavour, colour
- lower acidity
