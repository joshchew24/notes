# Cluster Thinning and Green Harvest
- fruit/cluster thinning begins after fruit set
	- aka Green Harvest, harvesting unripe grapes during veraison
- can continue through veraison
	- varies through vintage
- adjust/balance fruit load to leaf available
	- achieve optimal ripeness in remaining time of season
- high grape yields
	- slow ripening, potentically reducing fruit/wine quality
	- delay winter hardening/acclimation hence prone to cold damage
	- yields may be kept low in cool climates to achieve better wine quality and vine health
		- e.g. bilateral cordon: 2-6 ton/acre
