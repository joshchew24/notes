## Blending
- after [[Racking]] (2-3 times), the wine may be blended
- for enhanced complexity
- to "use up" leftover wines (economy blend)
- adjust sweetness, acidity, other attributes
	- e.g. lower pH, decrease bitterness
- oak & tank-aged wines often blended for balance
	- barrel bouquet (vanilla, spice, smoke) + grape varietal aroma
