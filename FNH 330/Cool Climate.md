# Cool Climate
- e.g. The Mosel or Rheingau in Germany
- short, cool growing season (14-16 C avg)
- cold winters
- cool to warm summers
## Pros
- good varietal character in white wines and Pinot Noir
## Cons
- short summers
	- fewer frost-free days
- spring/fall temperatures are call
- vintages quite variable
- heat accumulation for vines is at the lower limit for viticulture
- frost and winter cold injury
## Varieties
- chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Noir, Muller Thurgau
## Sub-climates
### Rain shadow
- mountain range blocks passage of rain-producing weather systems (storms)
	- casts "shadow" of dryness behind them
- example
	- Alsace, France
	- Marlborough, NZ
	- Pfalz Germany
	- semi-arid
		- Columbia Valley, Washington
		- OK Valley, BC
### South-facing River-bank
- Rheingau, Germany
- south aspect with moderate slope
	- optimal vineyard orientation
	- improved warming pattern over growing season
- wine-growing exceeds quality expectations for such a notherly cool climate
