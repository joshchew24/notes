# Pitfalls in Wine Tasting
- Adaptation
	- temporary loss in sensitivity to aroma/taste
		- occurs as stimulus compound satures mucus lining of [[Smell - Olfactory system|olfactory receptors]]
- palate fatigue
	- similar, but more a loss of ability to concentrate
		- e.g. tasting wines for many hours
- thresholds
	- people can vary in their thresholds of some tastes/aromas
	- outside "noise" can make it hard to sort out aromas
	- tired/sleepy makes it harder
- anosmia
	- smell "blind" for all aromas
	- can be genetic
	- triggered by polyps/tumour, head injury, viral infection
- taste modifiers
	- detergents
		- e.g. toothpaste
		- modify lipid-containing membranes of receptor cells in taste buds
		- wine tastes more sour/bitter, less sweet
	- food
		- have effect on tannin
		- sweetness reduces perception of tannin bitterness
		- fat/protein reduce perception of tannin astringency
- sequence of tasting wines modifies perception
	- sweet before dry causes dry to taste sour
- serving temperature
	- affects perception of wine components
	- warmer -> sweetness and aromas are heightened, body and acidity are muted
