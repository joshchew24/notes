## Fermentation
- fermented mainly using **wine yeast: *Saccharomyces cerevisiae***
	- can tolerate high ethanol concentrations
	- converts sugars in grape juice into ethanol, CO$_2$ and heat
	- ![[Pasted image 20250223175923.png]]
- temperature controlled at **12-18ËšC to preserve aromas**
	- higher temps cause white wine to lose aromas, create off aromas
	- tanks may have refrigerated jackets
- must is monitored closely for problems
	- once/twice a day tasting, analysis
- fermentation may start slowly, should be rapid once *Saccharomyces* population increases
- continues for a number of days to about 2 weeks
- CO$_2$ escapes through one-way valve to avoid pressure build up
- complete when all sugar is consumed (<2 g/L)
	- winemaker can stop fermentation if off-dry to sweet wine is desired
- wine is chilled, SO$_2$ added, then settled and racked off [[Lees|Gross lees]] (grape solids and particulates) 
### Types
#### Inoculated Fermentation
- single strain of *S. cerevisiae* is added (10$^6$ to 10$^7$ cells per mL)
- most common fermentation type
- fast and reliable
	- high numbers of *S. cerevisiae* out-compete other microorganisms, avoiding spoilage
#### Uninoculated/Spontaneous Fermentation
- **yeast on grapes** in winery conduct fermentation
- may produce more aromatic complexity
	- yeast variety yields different aroma compounds
- risk of spoilage
##### Fermentation Microorganisms
- grape surface contains microbes on the **waxy cuticle** (the **bloom**)
	- yeasts/fungi: ~100 - 10,000 cells
	- bacteria: ~100,000 cells
	- increased by 2 orders of magnitude in damaged berries
- wild yeasts (non-*Saccharomyces*)
	- *Kloeckera apiculata*
		- dominates until 4-5% EtOH (alcohol) kills it off
		- produces ethyl acetate
		- can create taints (glue, nail polish remover)
	- after fermentation, ***Pichia* yeasts** forms a film on wine surface
		- imparts oxidized/acetaldehyde aroma
- some *Saccharomyces* present at low levels from grapes and winery
	- as alcohol exceeds 4%, it begins to dominate (tolerates alcohol well)
		- often the only yeast at $\geq$ 10% ABV
