# Grape Harvesting
## Harvesting Methods
- choice depends on
	- labour training/incentives
	- pre-harvest thinning of undesirable berries
		- under-ripe, overripe, spoiled
	- rapid movement of berries to fermentor

### Mechanical Harvesting
- used for poor to near-premium quality wines
- grapes are removed from the stem
#### Pros
- faster
- more economical in the long run
	- higher upfront cost
- necessary if no (inexpensive) hand-labour available
#### Cons
- unselective
	- underripe, overripe, spoiled berries
- terrain problems (e.g. hills)
- not for all shoot-training systems
- higher risk of damaging grapes
	- more microbial activity early on
	- decreases potential wine quality
	- mitigate by harvesting on cool nights, use SO$_2$

### Hand Harvesting
- poor to premium quality wines

- night harvest
	- cooler, reduces oxidation and wild fermentation
- grapes are clustered
## Timing
- white and red grapes are harvested at different times and processed differently
### White Grapes
- harvested relatively early to allow for higher acidity and lower alcohol
- juice is pressed off skins to avoid skin bitter/astringent tannins/colour
### Red Grapes
- generally harvested later to reach high level of sugars, optimize colour/flavour and improve tannins
- fermented with skins
## Criteria
### Desired Wine Type
- some wineries focus on different types
- table wine, sparkling wine, late harvest wine, icewine, etc.
- wine quality
	- economy vs premium can dictate what time to harvest
		- must we wait longer to optimize grape quality for target wine quality?
		- dictated by vineyard site, grape condition, market trends
### Ripeness
- are the grape rip?
1. for optimal varietal aroma character?
	- depends on variety and/or style desired
	- e.g. Riesling
		- early harvest -> green apple aromas (modest quality)
		- later harvest -> honey/peach/apricot (medium quality)
	- e.g. Viognier
		- early-mid harvest -> orange-blossom aromas
		- mid harvest (optimal ripeness) -> orange blossom and apricot aromas (higher quality rating)
		- later harvest (past optimal) -> 
2. sugar, acid concentration and balance?
	- ~180 g/L sugars (18° [[Brix Scale|Brix]]) is appropriate minimum for better quality white wines (e.g. BC-VQA)
		- 18° Brix -> ~10.7% ABV
	- hang time
		- longer sun/heat exposure reduces acidity, increases sugar (more alcohol)
			- hard to get both
		- acidity in the must is generally optimal near 7-9 g/L
			- decreases during processing to about 6-8 g/L - good for most white table wines
		- cool climate grape often have excess acidity and not enough sugar
### Health of Grapes and Vineyard
- incidence of diseases/insects currently present?
	- is the problem minor/stable or spreading/problematic
### Weather
- damp, cool, rainy will speed disease spread
- rain before harvest will swell grapes and dilute juice
	- results in lower quality wine
- forecast of severe frost or dry/warm weather?
- in climate like BC, ripening period can often be shorter than in warmer climates
	- longer ripening period is more desirable
- cool temperatures slow microbial growth
	- harvest at night
### Misc
- grapes should be processed ASAP
	- ideally as soon as they harvested (same day)
- mechanically harvested grapes are especially prone to
	- oxidation and enzymatic browning of juice
	- microbial spoilage (off-odours, flavours in juice)
