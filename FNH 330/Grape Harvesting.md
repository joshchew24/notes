# Grape Harvesting
## Harvesting Methods
- choice depends on
	- labour training/incentives
	- pre-harvest thinning of undesirable berries
		- under-ripe, overripe, spoiled
	- rapid movement of berries to fermentor
### Mechanical Harvesting
- used for poor to near-premium quality wines
#### Pros
- faster
- more economical in the long run
	- higher upfront cost
- necessary if no (inexpensive) hand-labour available
#### Cons
- unselective
	- underripe, overripe, spoiled berries
- terrain problems (e.g. hills)
- not for all shoot-training systems
- higher risk of damaging grapes
	- more microbial activity early on
	- decreases potential wine quality
	- mitigate by harvesting on cool nights, use SO$_2$

### Hand Harvesting
- poor to premium quality wines

- night harvest
	- cooler, reduces oxidation and wild fermentation
## Timing
- white and red grapes are harvested at different times and processed differently
### White Grapes
- harvested relatively early to allow for higher acidity and lower alcohol
- juice is pressed off skins to avoid skin bitter/astringent tannins/colour
### Red Grapes
- generally harvested later to reach high level of sugars, optimize colour/flavour and improve tannins
- fermented with skins
## Criteria
### Desired Wine Type
- winery focus
	- table wine, sparkling wine, late harvest wine, icewine, etc.
- wine quality
