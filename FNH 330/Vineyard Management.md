# Vineyard Management
## Factors for Producing Quality Wine Grapes
## Factors to Manage in a Vineyard
### Water availability
- rainfall variable over season
- when permitted, certain regions need/use irrigation
	- controlled application of water to vineyard
		- e.g. sprinkler (overhead), drip (microjet), flood
### Water Deficit Management (WDM)
- in dry climates
- restrict irrigation to vineyard to enhance
	- berry maturation and ripening
	- restrict vegative growth
### Diseases
- mostly fungal
- e.g. powdery mildew, *Botrytis cinerea* (grey rot)
- control with careful canopy management
	- sulfur, fungicides, etc.
### Pests
- insects, e.g. leafhoppers and mealybugs
- control with insecticides, pest-predators
### Soil
#### Soil Nutrients
- soil nutrients: Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium (N, P, K), micronutrients
- inadequate nutrients
	- poor canopy growth
	- poor berry set, growth, ripening
- excess nutrients
	- overly vigorous vine growth
	- poor fruit set
	- high disease pressure = lower fruit quality
#### Soil Structure
- aggregation of soil particles
- influences how roots grow
- retention of water/drainage
- rocks hardpan/heavy clay soils
	- impede root growth
	- impede access to water
	- impair water drainage
- sandy soils
	- poor water holding capacity (drains too fast)
	- vine can't maintain its growth
		- results in wilting an dpossibly death
#### Managing Soil Nutrients and Structure
- add organic matter (manure, compost)
	- improves structure and drainage
	- adds slow-release nutrients
	- in sandy soils, add with drip irrigation (fertigation)
- select rootstocks/varieties suited for high-nutrient/low-nutrient soil
- plow deeply or install drainage pipe/tiles to improve drainage
	- allow for deeper root growth
### Balancing Vegatative/Fruit Growth
#### excess fruit for canopy and roots
- delays ripening
- tends to prevent full ripening of berries (poor wine quality)
- delays grapevine acclimation for winter
	- greater risk of frost and severe winter cold damage to vins/buds
#### Overly Vegatative Vine
- excess shading of inner leaves and fruit
- poor quality wine-grapes
	- underripe, low aroma
- increased winter injury
	- focuses too much energy on vegatative growth rather than roots for preparing for winter
- high humidity in canopy
	- increases disease and pest pressure (sprays cannot reach target) on fruit
- if leaves above "light compensation point", net export of sugars (benefit fruit)
- if below LCP, they impor tsugars (deprive fruit)
