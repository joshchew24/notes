# Soil
- anchors the vine, growing medium
- contains nutrients and water essential for growth
- partly mediates vine's growth rate and balance between reproductive (fruit) and vegetative growth
## Particles and components
- sand
	- coarse particles = rapid drainage
	- e.g. black sage region of south Okanagan Valley
- clay
	- adds nutrients
	- increases **water holding capacity (WHC)**
	- increases **nutrient holding capacity (NHC)**
	- greatly slows drainage
		- e.g. Niagara Peninsula, ON
		- need to install drainage tiles
- silt
	- from river deposits
	- adds nutrients
	- moderate WHC and NHC
	- moderately slows drainage
- limestone/chalk
	- adds calcium
		- imperically alters wine flavour
	- drains moderately
		- e.g. Chablis, France
> [!Note]
> soils can be a combination of the above components, e.g. loam: silt and sand + some clay (Fraser Valley)
- organic matter
	- compost/manure may be added to any soil
	- improves WHC, NHC
	- moderately improves drainage
	- adds slow-release nutrients
## Ideal soil
- can be grown on many soils
- soil may be **managed** 
	- to promote desirable vine growth
	- vines/wines to reflect the soil type
	- if cannot be practically modified, plant the right variety of wine grape/rootstock
