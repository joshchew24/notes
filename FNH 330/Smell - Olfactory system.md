# Smell - Olfactory system
- aromas or flavors
	- volatile, soluble in mucus
	- bind to olfactory receptors in olfactory bulb
	- cause signal transmission to brain
- two routes to olfactory bulb
	- orthonasally (aroma)
	- retronasally (flavour)

## Olfactory Bulb
- 2.5cm2
- 5-20 million receptor cells
- up to 400 different receptor types in humans

## Interaction of Molecules and Receptors
- Old view: lock+key mechanism: receptor complementary to aroma molecule
- Recent: receptors bind with specific chemical features of a molecule
	- or different molecules attach to the same binding site in different ways
- Many aromas (e.g. “coffee”) = multiple compounds interacting with receptors
- binding of molecules with receptors causes a pattern of activation that is interpreted by the brain
	- patterns are processed and stored/matched to existing memory
