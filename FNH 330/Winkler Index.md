# Winkler Index
- uses growing degree days (GDD)
	- measure of heat accumulation in a growing system![[Pasted image 20250122102909.png]]
## GDDs
- sum of daily avg temp minus 10ºC
- variation in GDD among vintages is typical
	- results in quality diff
### Process
1. take avg daily temperature for each day of the growing season $\frac{\text{max temp} + \text{min temp}}{2}$
2. subtract 10 from each day
3. sum values for each day of growing season (if positive)
### Example
Day 1 high: 20°C
Day 1 low: 10°C
(20+10)/2 = 15
15 °C - 10 = 5 GDD
Day 1 + Day 2
5 GDD + 6 GDD
=11 GDD
