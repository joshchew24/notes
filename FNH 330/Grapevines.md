# Grapevines
## Basic form/function/development
- new grapevine starts from compound bud on a grapevine cane
- **asexual propagation** by either
	- plant a vine cane with buds in the ground to grow roots
	- graft compound bud to a North American rootstock
		- desired *V. vinifera* compound bud wood is used as a scion
			- Scion: compound bud wood generates a new shoot
		- prevent dessication of graft union and bud using wax coating
### Process
- graft planted in winter/spring
- late spring
	- leaves, inflorescences, flowers, etc.
	- vascular systems of compound bud and R/S join to make one whole plant (shoot)
	- rootstock forms new roots
- early summer
	- grape/flowers bloom (bees not needed)
- mid summer
	- seeds mature and berries develop into clusters
	- [[Veraison]]
- sept/oct
	- ripe
- early/mid fall
	- harvested
- winter
	- vine prepares for, then goes into dormancy
- 2-3 years
	- mature vine is formed with pruning and training
## Rootstock (R/S)
- in NA, *Vitis riparia, V. berlandieri, V. rotundifolia, V. rupestris*
- used mainly for protection against phylloxera (root louse)
- can also select for rootstock for
	- resistance/tolerance to nematodes
	- specific soil types
		- alkaline/saline
		- slow/fast drainage
	- high/low vigour
## Shoot
- form a compound bud
- producs flowers in 1st 2-5 basal nodes
- tendrils for climbing
- produces flower buds for next year in basal buds
- keeps growing until too stressed
