# Preparing the Must - Juice Clarification
## Preparing the Must - Juice Clarification
- remove solids from wine that can impart vegetal aromas
- juice pumped into settling tanks (refrigerated)
- juice topped with CO$_2$ or N$_2$ to deter oxidation/microbial growth (if there's head space in the tank)
- settling agents (e.g. hydrated silicon dioxide) often added to help clarify the juice
- settling occurs for about 24 hours

	- [[Racking]] - leave grape cell debris (stabilizes juice)
	- avoids development of reduced-sulfur taints
- large wineries can use centrifuge
