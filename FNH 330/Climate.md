# Climate
- expected and known long-term average regional weather
- weather
	- growing season temperature, sunshine, cloud, rainfall conditions for single year
	- highly influences yield and quality for that [[Vintage]]
## Ideal climate
- sufficient and timely rainfall (or irrigation)
- sufficient heat
- sufficient sunlight
- light winds
	- dry vineyards after rainfall/irrigation in high humidity areas
- low to no frost
- low to no hail
- no drought
- no late season rainfall
## Latitudes amenable to grape growing
- temperate zone between 30th and 50th parallels
	- indigenous to northern hemisphere
	- can be grown in southern hemisphere
## Four Recognized Climates
### [[Mediterranean Climate]]
### [[Continental Climate]]
### [[Maritime Climate]]
### [[Cool Climate]]
### [[Unique Sub-Climates]]
## Slope & Aspect
- slope is slope
- aspect is cardinal direction of slope
	- facing sun is better
	- in Northern Hemisphere
		- South + higher slope
		- ENW, higher slope means less sun exposure
