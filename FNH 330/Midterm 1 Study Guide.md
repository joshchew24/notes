	e) Botrytis cinerea
10) When someone is anosmic, that person:
	a) confuses red and green
	b) has olfactory fatigue
	c) lacks the gene for alcohol dehydrogenase and consequently has a very low tolerance level for alcohol
	d) is unable to perceive aromas/flavours
	e) is unable to perceive tastes
11) When considering the aromas/flavours of a wine, the ___ threshold refers to the smallest amount of a substance that can be identified.
	a) impulse 
	b) detection 
	c) recognition 
	d) gustatory 
	e) olfactory
12) The scientific classification (genus & species) of one of the main native wine grapes from North America is
	a) Vitis vinifera 
	b) Vitis berlandieri 
	c) Vinis riparia 
	d) Saccharomyces cerevisiae
13) The varietal aromas of wines (e.g. lychee) typically come from
	a) the skins of the grapes 
	b) the seeds of the grapes
	 c) fermentation
	d) the oak barrels 
	e) the pulp of the grapes
	f) all the above
14) The country with the most wine production globally is typically:
	a) Germany 
	b) Italy 
	c) South Africa 
	d) New Zealand 
	e) USA 
	f) Australia
15) The aroma compound released by ladybugs caught in grape must is very similar to
	a) grape terpenes
	b) grape hexanals that has a green apple/vegetal aroma
	c) grape norisoprenoids
	d) grape methoxypyrazines
	e) all of the above
16) For red wines, the berry surface:volume ratio is especially important to
	a) disease resistance 
	b) photosynthesis 
	c) the ratio of sugars to acids
	d) alcohol level 
	e) colour and tannin concentration
17) Winter pruning generally removes about

	c) 40% of canes 
	d) 80% of buds 
	e) 90% of buds

19) Describe basal leaf removal and explain what its benefits are.
20) Two examples of a vine training system are the “Double Guyot” and “bush/umbrella” systems.
	A. Briefly describe this system (plus a simple diagram with labels to illustrate is recommended) and its renewal system.
	B. (2 marks) Briefly describe one other example of a wine grape training system. Include a simple diagram with labels.
21) Connect the month with the number of a main activity/process/event that is most often associated with it (for a typical vineyard in the Okanagan for example.)
	a) late August 1. unwanted canes/buds are pruned off
	b) August  2. Bloom
	c) January-February 3. Netting and/or noisemakers are set up
	d) early May  4. Frost protection is used
	e) October-November  5. Veraison

	g) September  7. Harvest
22) Vine balance (vegetative growth is balanced with fruit growth) is important for grape growing. Describe how the vine and crop are impacted if vegetative growth is too low or too high.
23) A vineyard in the Fraser Valley has decided to track its heat accumulation over the growing season. They are recording the highest and the lowest temperatures in every 24-hour period (day). How would you recommend they use this data to track heat accumulation? Show any example calculations that may be necessary.
