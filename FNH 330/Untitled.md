FNH 330 2024W2 Introduction to Wine Science
MIDTERM 1 STUDY GUIDE

These are questions you can expect to see on the midterm. If you have questions (or answers), you can
post on the discussion board or see Jay during office hours (on Zoom).

Check your lecture notes, lecture PDFs, and lab-book to date for the information needed below. Some
questions refer to the lecture material to be covered this week before the midterm exam.

Note questions are not in the order that the material was/will be covered.

Circle one best answer for each question or fill in the blank with the correct answer (one mark each
unless otherwise indicated)

a) 60% of buds b) 10% of canes c) 40% of canes d) 80% of buds e) 90% of buds

5) (4 marks) Discuss benefits & limitations in using mechanical harvesting for wine-grapes instead of
hand-picking:

6) Describe basal leaf removal and explain what its benefits are.

7) Two examples of a vine training system are the “Double Guyot” and “bush/umbrella” systems.

A. Briefly describe this system (plus a simple diagram with labels to illustrate is recommended) and its
renewal system.

B. (2 marks) Briefly describe one other example of a wine grape training system. Include a simple diagram
with labels.


8) Connect the month with the number of a main activity/process/event that is most often associated
with it (for a typical vineyard in the Okanagan for example.)

10) A vineyard in the Fraser Valley has decided to track its heat accumulation over the growing season.
They are recording the highest and the lowest temperatures in every 24-hour period (day). How would
you recommend they use this data to track heat accumulation? Show any example calculations that may
be necessary.
