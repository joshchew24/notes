## Pre-fermentation Adjustments
### Chaptalization
- addition of sugar to increase final ABV
	- if necessary and legal
- 17 g/L sugar raises ABV by 1%
- can also use sucrose (if alloewd) or rectified concentrated grape must

### Balancing pH
#### Low pH (high acidity)
- acid level is > 10 g/L
- pH < 3.1
- add calcium carbonate, Acidex (potassium bicarbonate + potassium bitartrate)
	- basic compounds neutralize acid
	- acidity tends to go down during fermentation, can be adjusted afterwards
- blend with lower acidity juice
- **amelioration**
	- acidic juice diluted with water, sugar added before fermentation
	- used in low quality economy wines
#### High pH (low acidity)
- acid level is < 6-8 g/L
- pH > 3.4
- add tartaric acid to low-acid juice
