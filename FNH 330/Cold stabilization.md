## Cold stabilization
- white wines must be "cold stabilized"
- potassium hydrogen tartrate (KHT) can precipitate out of wines when chilled - "wine diamonds"
- chilling the wine to -4ËšC for several days causes precipitation of KHT crystals
- wine is racked off precipitate while cold
- should be performed after blending/acid adjustments
