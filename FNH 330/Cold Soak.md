# Cold Soak
- grape must be held at 5-10ÂºC for an extended period (12hrs - several days) 
- pre-fermentation **cold maceration** 
	- longer cold soak, more intense maceration
	- extracts flavour/colour more effectively
	- post-fermentation focus on tannin softening
- enhance colour, aroma and fruit expression without extracting too much tanninc
- prevent oxidation and microbial spoilage by
	- adding inert gas such as CO$_2$ to displace oxygen
	- add SO$_2$ to grape must
	- keep temperature low
