## Optional Steps - Post-fermentation
### Post-fermentation treatments
- add **glucosidase enzymes ($\beta$-glucosidases)** 
	- increases volatile aromas in aromatic white wines

	- sugar chains detached -> more volatile aromas
### Sur Lie and Batonnage (lees stirring)
- technique for non-aromatic white wines
- stabilizes proteins (reduces haze)
	- clarifies
- stabilizes tartrates (reduces precipitation)
	- formation of crystals
- increases body
- imparties creamier, fuller mouthfeel
- releases enzymes that increase desirable aromatic compounds
- if anaerobic wine spends too long over the lees, can pick up **rotting yeast** (sulfur-compound) aromas
	- can also have subtle **brioche** or **nutty** notes
	- prevented by batonnage
- wine without lees contact can feel **fresher**, **fruitier**
#### Sur Lie
- wine remains in contact with [[Lees|Fine lees]] for several weeks to 6 months in barrels/tanks
- breakdown of yeast cells (autolysis) releases compounds that improve texture, body, roundness, reduce astringency
	- **mannoproteins**
	- **polysaccharides**
- common in [[Chardonnay]], [[Muscadet]], and some [[Chenin Blanc]]s
#### Batonnage
- stirred periodically with rod/paddle to keep [[Fine lees]] suspended
- increases yeast interaction
### Malolactic Fermentation
- some whites (e.g. [[Chardonnay]]) may undergo **malolactic fermentation (MLF)**
- controlled MLF with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) *Oenococcus oeni* stabilizes wine and provides softer acidity, adds complexity (buttery)
