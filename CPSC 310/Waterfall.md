- explicit hand-offs between stakeholders in each adjacent step
- explicit exit criteria must be validated for a phase to be considered complete
- extreme push back against revisiting a prior phase
#### Shortcomings
- requirements are often imperfectly understood at project outset, but stay fixed throughout development
- value of the system cannot be validated until fully complete
