# Code Smells
- properties of code that are symptomatic of specific deficiencies
	- often structural deficiencies
		- i.e. structural inhibitors to change
	- readability deficiency
		- consequently, code is harder to evolve and change
- considered a form of [[Tech Debt]]
- smells often arise when code evolve
	- defects are fixed and new futures are added
	- original design is obfuscated
	- new additions introduce coupling and reduce cohesion
