# RoomDataset
- geolocation?
	- processFileContents(content)
		- read index.htm from zip
		- parse index.htm to AST
		- find buildings table (contains one of the valid classes)
			- buildingTableSearchStack = \[root\]
			- while buildingTableSearchStack.length != 0
				- currnode = stack.pop()
				- if currNode has nodename table and attr class = "views-table", break loop
				- else, push child nodes to buildingTableSearchStack
					- using DFS arbitrarily
					- can change this to check performance times but queues have a dequeue time complexity of O(n))
		- simultaneously validate table and generate list of bulilding paths
			- validate header classes
			- iterate through TR nodes(?)
				- validate classes
				- save code (shortname), long name, address, href as objects in array
		- iterate through buliding list
			- if href link DNE, skip
			- find room table
				- validate header classes
				- iterate through TR
					- validate classes
					- get room number, seats, room type, furniture type
				- construct name (room id = shortname + number)
				- return list of valid rooms
			- if valid room list is empty, skip this building
			- else, GET geolocation and populate lat and lon
