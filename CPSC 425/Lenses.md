- focuses rays from infinity at the focal length of the lens
- points passing through the centre of the lens are not bent

pinhole model equation
$$\frac{y'}{z'}=\frac{y}{z}$$$$\frac{y'}{z'-f} = \frac{y}{f}$$
$$\frac{y'}{y}=\frac{z'}{z} = \frac{z'-y}{f}$$
$$\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{z'}$$
$$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{z'}+\frac{1}{z}$$

- $f$ = focal length
- $z'$ = focus distance
- $z$ = object distance
## question
A 50mm lens is focussed at infinity. It now moves to focus on something 5m away. How far does the lens move?
$z=5$
