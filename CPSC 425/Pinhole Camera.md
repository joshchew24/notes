- need to have mathematical relationship betwee nobject and image position

$$\frac{x'}{f'} = \frac{x}{z}$$
$$x' = f'\frac{x}{z}$$
$$y' = f'\frac{y}{z}$$
#question why did x become y

- z means as an object is further away from the image plane, their image gets smaller
- increase focal length decreases the field of view

$$tan(\frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{w}{2f})$$
$$\theta = 2arctan(\frac{w}{2f})$$
## Orthographic Projection
![[Pasted image 20250107185525.png]]
## Weak Perspective
- fixed depth $z = z_0$
- objects are at a constant depth (or relatively constant depth)
	- can use a weak perspetive model, i.e. assume all depths are the same
		- i.e. linear mapping betewen x and x'
- e.g. satellite imagery

## cons 


## compared to lenses
[[Lenses]]
- collects all the light
- light is only focused on a particular image plane
