# Exercise Sheet 3 Response
## Question 1
1. The methods called before the first table row is printed are: `t.evaluate(writer)`, `color.evaluate(writer)`. The first table row will be printed in bold because the loop tells the `row` object to invoke its `evaluate()` method. The `BoldRow` will correctly call its own `evaluate` and print a bold row.
2. The methods called before the first table row is printed are: `Evaluator.evaluate(Table ta, PrintWriter writer)`, `Evaluator.evaluate(ta.getColour(), writer)`. The first table row will not be printed in bold because the loop that prints the rows is agnostic to the actual type of the rows, and simply invokes the `Row.evaluate()` method. So, any `BoldRow` that passes through the loop will use the parent `Row.Evaluate()` method.
3. The methods called before the first table row is printed are: `Evaluator.visit(Table ta, PrintWriter writer)`, `colour.accept(this, writer)`, `Evaluator.visit(Colour c, PrintWriter writer)`. The first table row will be printed in bold because the `row.accept(this, writer)` method will dispatch into the `BoldRow` class, which then dispatches the correct `Evaluator.visit(BoldRow r PrintWriter writer)` method. 
4. The methods called before the first table row is printed are: `Evaluator.visit(Table ta, PrintWriter writer)`, `Evaluator.visit(Colour c, PrintWriter writer)`. The first table row will not be printed in bold for the same reason as in part b. The call to `visit(r, writer)` will not know whether the row is a `BoldRow` or not, so will only call the `Evaluator.visit(Row r, PrinterWriter writer)` method.
